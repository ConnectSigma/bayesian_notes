But what if you cannot draw independent samples? Solution: Markov Chain Monte Carlo are a class of algorithms to sample from a distribution when independent samples cannot be drawn. However, the samples in MCMC will be dependent. 2.3 References Stan Development Team (2016 Ch. 28) "],
["mcmc-diagnostics.html", "3 MCMC Diagnostics 3.1 Convergence Diagnostics 3.2 Autocorrelation, Effective Sample Size, and MCSE 3.3 HMC Specific Diagnostics 3.4 References", " 3 MCMC Diagnostics There are two parts of checking a Bayesian model: diagnostics: Is the sampler working? Is it adequately approximating the specified posterior distribution: \\(p(\\theta | D)\\). model fit: Does the model adequately represent the data? 3.1 Convergence Diagnostics Under certain conditions, MCMC algorithms will draw a sample from the target posterior distribution after it has converged to equilbrium. However, since in practice, any sample is finite, there is no guarantee about whether its converged, or is close enough to the posterior distribution. In general there is no way to prove that the sampler has converged.1 However, there are several statistics that indicate that a sampler has not converged. 3.1.1 Potential Scale Reduction (\\(\\hat{R}\\)) In equilibrium, the distribution of samples from chains should be the same regardless of the initial starting values of the chains (Stan Development Team 2016, Sec 28.2). One way to check this is to compare the distributions of multiple chains—in equilibrium they should all have the same mean. Additionally, the split \\(\\hat{R}\\) tests for convergence by splitting the chain in half, and testing the hypothesis that the means are the same in each half. This tests for non-stationarity within a chain. See Stan Development Team (2016 Sec 28.2) for the equations to calculate these. TODO: Examples of passing and non-passing Rhat chains using fake data generated from known functions with a given autocorrelation. Rule of Thumb: The rule of thumb is that R-hat values for all less than 1.1 source. Note that all parameters must show convergence. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for convergence. 3.2 Autocorrelation, Effective Sample Size, and MCSE MCMC samples are dependent. This does not effect the validity of inference on the posterior if the samplers has time to explore the posterior distribution, but it does affect the efficiency of the sampler. In other words, highly correlated MCMC samplers requires more samples to produce the same level of Monte Carlo error for an estimate. 3.2.1 Autocorrelation The effective sample size (ESS) measures the amount by which autocorrelation in samples increases uncertainty (standard errors) relative to an independent sample. Suppose that the \\(\\rho^2_t\\) is the ACF function of a sample of size \\(N\\), the effective sample size, \\(N_eff\\), is \\[ N_{eff} = \\frac{N}{\\sum_{t = -\\infty}^\\infty \\rho_t} = \\frac{N}{1 + 2 \\sum_{t = -\\infty}^\\infty \\rho_t}. \\] TODO show that if \\(\\rho_t = 1\\) for all \\(t\\) then \\(N_eff = 1\\), and if \\(\\rho_t = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) then \\(N_eff = N\\). See also Stan Development Team (2016 Sec 28.4), Geyer (2011), and Gelman et al. (2013). Thinning Since the autocorrelation tends to decrease as the lag increases, thinning samples will reduce the final autocorrelation in the sample while also reducing the total number of samples saved. Due to the autocorrelation, the reduction in the number of effective samples will often be less than number of samples removed in thinning. Both of these will produce 1,000 samples from the poserior, but effective sample size of \\(B\\) will be greater than the effective sample size of \\(A\\), since after thinnin g the autocorrelation in \\(B\\) will be lower. A Generating 1,000 samples after convergence and save all of them B Generating 10,000 samples after convergence and save every 10th sample In this case, A produces 10,000 samples, and B produces 1,000. The effective sample size of A will be higher than B. However, due to autocorrelation, the proportional reduction in the effective sample size in B will be less than the thinning: \\(N_{eff}(A) / N_{eff}(B) &lt; 10\\). A Generating 10,000 samples after convergence and save all of them B Generating 10,000 samples after convergence and save every 10th sample Thinning trades off sample size for memory, and due to autocorrelation in samples, loss in effective sample size is less than the loss in sample size. Example: Comparison of the effective sample sizes for data generated with various levels of autocorrelation. The package rstan does not directly expose the function it uses to calculate ESS, so this ess function does so (for a single chain). ess &lt;- function(x) { N &lt;- length(x) V &lt;- map_dbl(seq_len(N - 1), function(t) { mean(diff(x, lag = t) ^ 2, na.rm = TRUE) }) rho &lt;- head_while(1 - V / var(x), `&gt;`, y = 0) N / (1 + sum(rho)) } n &lt;- 1024 ess(rnorm(n)) #&gt; [1] 1024 ess(arima.sim(list(ar = 0.5), n)) #&gt; [1] 1024 ess(arima.sim(list(ar = 0.75), n)) #&gt; [1] 653 ess(arima.sim(list(ar = 0.875), n)) #&gt; [1] 328 ess(arima.sim(list(ar = 0.99), n)) #&gt; [1] 67 3.2.2 Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE) The Monte Carlo standard error is the uncertainty about a statistic in the sample due to sampling error. With a independent sample of size \\(N\\), the MCSE for the sample mean is \\[ MCSE(\\bar{\\theta}) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}} \\] where \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation. However, MCMC are generally not independent, and the MCSE will be higher than that of an independent sample. One way to calculate the MCSE with autocorrelated samples is to use the effective sample size instead of the sample size, \\[ MCSE(\\bar{\\theta}) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N_{eff}}} \\] MCSE for common values: the mean, and any posterior probabilities: mean \\(s_\\theta / \\sqrt{S}\\) probability \\(\\sqrt{p (1 - p) / S}\\) The estimation of standard errors for quantiles, as would be used in is more complicated. See the package mcmcse for Monte Carlo standard errors of quantiles (though calculated in a different method than rstan). See Gelman et al. (2013 Sec. 10.5). 3.3 HMC Specific Diagnostics HMC produces several diagnostics that indicate that the sampler is breaking and, thus, not sampling from the posterior distribution. This is unusual, as most Bayesian sampling methods do not give indication of whether they are working well, and all that can be checked are the properties of the samples themselves with methods like \\(\\hat{R}\\). The two diagnostics that HMC provides are divergent transitions maximum treedepth The HMC sampler has two tuning parameters Stepsize: Length of the steps to take Treedepth: Number of steps to take Stan chooses intelligent defaults for these values. However, this does not always work, and the divergent transitions and maximum treedepth tuning parameters indicate that these parameters should be adjusted. 3.3.1 Divergent transitions The problem: The details of the HMC are technical and can be found TODO. The gist of the problem is that Stan is using a discrete approximation of a continuous function when integrating. If the step sizes are too large, the discrete approximation does not work. Helpfully, when the approximation is poor it does not fail without any indication but will produce “divergent transitions”. If there are too many divergent transitions, then the sampler is not drawing samples from the entire posterior and inferences will be biased The solution: Reduce the step size. This can be done by increasing the the adapt_delta parameter. This is the target average proposal acceptance probability in the adaptation, which is used to determine the step size during warmup. A higher desired acceptance probability (closer to 1) reduces the the step size. A smaller step size means that it will require more steps to explore the posterior distribution. See Stan Development Team (2016, 380) 3.3.2 Maximum Treedepth The problem: NUTS is an intelligent method to select the number of steps to take in each iteration. However, there is still a maximum number of steps that NUTS will try. If the sampler is often hitting the maximum number of steps, it means that the optimal number of steps to take in each iteration is higher than the maximum. While divergent transitions bias inference, a too-small maximum treedepth only affects efficiency. The sampler is still exploring the posterior distribution, but the exploration will be slower and the autocorrelation higher (effective sample size lower) than if the maximum treedepth were set higher. The solution: Increase the maximum treedepth. 3.4 References see Gelman et al. (2013, 267) Stan2016a [Ch 28.] for how Stan calculates Rhat, autocorrelations, and ESS. See Flegal, Haran, and Jones (2008) and the mcmcse for methods to calculate MCMC standard errors and an argument for using ESS as a stopping rule for Bayesian inference. Talk by Geyer on MCSE This is also the case in optimization with non-convex objective functions.↩ "],

One we have the posterior distribution, or more often a sample from the posterior distribution, it is relatively easy to perform inference on any function of the posterior. Common statistics used to summarize the posterior distribution: mean: \\(\\E(p(\\theta | y)) \\approx \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{i = 1}^S \\theta^{(s)}\\) median: \\(\\median(p(\\theta | y)) \\approx \\median \\theta^{(s)}\\) quantiles: 2.5%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 97.5% credible interval: central credible interval: the interval between the p/2% and 1 - p/2% quantiles highest posterior density interval: the narrowest interval containing p% of distribution marginal densities 4.3 Functions of the Posterior Distribution It is also easy to conduct inference on functions of the posterior distribution. Suppose \\(\\theta^{(1)}, \\dots, \\theta^{(S)}\\) are a sample from \\(p(\\theta | y)\\), the \\(f(\\theta^{(1)}), \\dots, f(\\theta^{(S)})\\) are a sample from \\(p(f(\\theta) | y)\\). This is not easy for methods like MLE that produce point estimates: Even in OLS, non-linear functions coefficients generally require either the Delta method or bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals. Berry, Golder, and Milton (2012), Golder (2017),Brambor, Clark, and Golder (2006) discuss calculating confidence intervals See Rainey (2016b) on “transformation induced bias” See Carpenter (2016) on how reparameterization affects point estimates; this is a Stan Case study with working code 4.4 Marginal Effects 4.4.1 Example: Marginal Effect Plot for X Berry, Golder, and Milton (2012) replicates Alexseev (2006) as an example of a model with an interaction between \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\). \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_x X + \\beta_z Z + \\beta_{xz} X Z + \\epsilon \\] In this case, the hypothesis of interest involves the marginal effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\), \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\E(Y|.)}{\\partial X} = \\beta_z + \\beta_{xz} Z \\] Since there is an interaction, the marginal effect of \\(X\\) is not simply the coefficient \\(\\beta_z\\), but is a function of another predictor, \\(Z\\). Point estimates of the marginal effects with interactions are relatively easy to construct, but confidence intervals for the MLE estimates quickly involve multiple terms and either the Delta method approximation or bootstrapping to calculate. We will consider this problem from a Bayesian estimation perspective, and calculate point estimates (posterior mean) and credible intervals of the marginal effects. The particular example is Alexseev (2006), which analyzes how changes in the ethnic composition of Russian regions affected the vote share of the extreme Russian nationalist Zhirinovsky Bloc in 2003 Russian State Duma elections.[^alexseev1] alexseev &lt;- read_dta(&quot;data/alexseev.dta&quot;) [alexseev1]: Some of the replication code and material can be found on Matt Golder’s website. One claim of Alexseev (2006) was that support for anti-immigrant parties depends on the percentage of the population of the dominant ethnic group (Slavic) and the change in the percentage the non-dominant share. To test that hypothesis, Alexseev (2006) estimates the following model, \\[ \\begin{multline} \\mathtt{xenovote}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_s \\mathtt{slavicshare}_i + \\beta_{n} \\mathtt{changenonslav} + \\\\ \\beta_{sn} (\\mathtt{slavicshare}_i \\times \\mathtt{changenonslav}_i) + \\gamma z_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}, \\end{multline} \\] where \\(z_i\\) is a vector of control variables. xenovote: Xenophobic voting. Share of vote for the Zhironovsky Bloc. slavicshare: Slavic Share. Proportion Slavic in the district. changenonslav: \\(\\Delta\\) non-Slavic Share Change in the proprotion of non-Slavic groups in the region.

Since the number of lines would be too many to display effectively, plot 256 of them: dydx_all %&gt;% filter(.iter %in% sample(unique(.iter), 2 ^ 8)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = changenonslav, y = value, group = .iter)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.3) + ylab(&quot;Marginal effect of slavic share&quot;) + xlab(paste(expression(Delta, &quot;non-Slavic Share&quot;))) Alternatively, we can summarize the posterior distribution of the marginal effects with a line (posterior mean) and credible interval regions (50%, 90%): dydx_summary &lt;- dydx_all %&gt;% group_by(changenonslav) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(value), q5 = quantile(value, 0.05), q25 = quantile(value, 0.25), q75 = quantile(value, 0.75), q95 = quantile(value, 0.95)) ggplot() + modelr::geom_ref_line(h = 0) + geom_ribbon(data = dydx_summary, mapping = aes(x = changenonslav, ymin = q5, ymax = q95), alpha = 0.2) + geom_ribbon(data = dydx_summary, mapping = aes(x = changenonslav, ymin = q25, ymax = q75), alpha = 0.2) + geom_line(data = dydx_summary, mapping = aes(x = changenonslav, y = mean), colour = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_rug(data = alexseev, mapping = aes(x = changenonslav), sides = &quot;b&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Marginal effect of slavic share&quot;) + xlab(expression(paste(Delta, &quot;non-Slavic Share&quot;))) The plot above also includes a rug with the observed values of changenonslav in the sample. Q: For each value of changenonslav, what is the probability that the marginal effect of slavicshare is greater than 0? Q: Reestimate the model, but calculate the marginal effect of slavicshare for all observed values of changenonslav in the sample. For each observation, calculate the probability that the marginal effect is greater than 0. What proporation of observations is the probability that the marginal effect is greater than zero. Q: Suppose you want to calculate the expected probability that the marginal effect of slavicshare is greater than zero in the sample. Let \\(\\theta^{S}_i\\) be the parameter for the marginal effect of slavicshare on the xenovote. Consider these two calculations: \\[ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\left( \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s = 1}^S I(\\theta^{(s)}_i &gt; 0) \\right) \\] and \\[ \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s = 1}^S \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N I(\\theta^{(s)}_i &gt; 0) \\right) . \\] Are they the same? What are their substantive interpretations? Q: Construct the same plot but for Figure 5(b) in Berry, Golder, and Milton (2012), which displays the marginaleffects of \\(\\Delta\\) non-Slavic on Xenophobic voting.

["model-checking.html", "5 Model Checking 5.1 Why check models? 5.2 Posterior Predictive Checks 5.3 Sources", " 5 Model Checking 5.1 Why check models? In theory—Bayesian model should include all relevant substantive knowledge and subsume all possible theories. In practice—It won’t. Need to check how the model fits data. The question is not whether a model is “true”; it isn’t (Box 1976). But is it good enough for the purposes of the analysis. See Gelman, Meng, and Stern (1996), Gelman (2007), Gelman (2009), Gelman et al. (2013 Ch. 6), Gelman and Shalizi (2012b), Kruschke (2013), Gelman and Shalizi (2012a), Gelman (2014) for more discussion of the motivation and use of posterior predictive checks. 5.2 Posterior Predictive Checks One way to evaluate the fit of a model is posterior predictive checks Fit the model to the data to get the posterior distribution of the parameters: \\(p(\\theta | D)\\) Simulate data from the fitted model: \\(p(\\tilde{D} | \\theta, D)\\) Compare the simulated data (or a statistic thereof) to the observed data and a statistic thereof. The comparison between data simulated from the model can be formal or visual. Within a Stan function, this is done in the generated quantities block using a _rng distribution functions: generated quantities { vector[n] yrep; for (i in 1:n) { yrep[i] ~ } } The package bayesplot includes multiple functions for posterior predictive checks; see the help for PPC-overview for a summary of these functions. 5.2.1 Bayesian p-values A posterior predictive p-value is a the tail posterior probability for a statistic generated from the model compared to the statistic observed in the data. Let \\(y = (y_1, \\dots, y_n)\\) be the observed data. Suppose the model has been fit and there is a set of simulation \\(\\theta^(s)\\), \\(s = 1, \\dots, n_sims\\). In replicated dataset, \\(y^{rep(s)\\), has been generated from the predictive distribution of the data, \\(p(y^{(rep)} | \\theta = \\theta^{(s)}\\). Then the ensemble of simulated datasets, \\((y^{rep(s)}, \\dots, y^{rep(nsims)})\\), is a sample from the posterior predictive distribution, \\(p(y^{(rep)} | y)\\) The model can be tested by means of discrepancy statistics, which are some function of the data and parameters, \\(T(y, \\theta)\\). If \\(\\theta\\) was known, then compare discrepancy by \\(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta)\\). The statistical significance is \\(p = \\Pr(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta) &gt; T(y, \\theta) | y, \\theta)\\). If \\(\\theta\\) is unknown, then average over the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\), \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p &amp;= \\Pr(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta) &gt; T(y, \\theta) | y) \\\\ &amp;= \\int Pr(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta) &gt; T(y, \\theta) | y, \\theta) p(\\theta | y) d\\,\\theta , \\end{aligned} \\] which is easily estimated from the MCMC samples as, \\[ p = \\frac{1}{n_{sims}}\\sum_{s = 1}^{n_{sims}} 1( T(y^{rep(s)}, \\theta(s)) &gt; T(y, \\theta(s))) \\] 5.2.2 Test quantities The definition of a posterior p-value does not specify a particular test-statistic, \\(T\\), to use. The best advice is that \\(T\\) depends on the application. Gelman et al. (2013, 146) Speed of light example uses the 90% interval (61st and 6th order statistics). Gelman et al. (2013, 147) binomial trial example uses the number of swicthes (0 to 1, or 1 to 0) in order to test independence. Gelman et al. (2013, 148) hierarchical model for adolesce smoking uses percent of adolescents in the sample who never smoked percentage in the sample who smoked in all waves precentage of “incident smoker”: adolescents who began the study and non-smokers and ended as smokers. 5.2.3 p-values vs. u-values A posterior predictive p-value is different than a classical p-value. Posterior predictive p-value distributed uniform if the model is true Classical p-value distributed uniform if the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is true A u-value is any function of the data that has a \\(U(0, 1)\\) sampling distribution (Gelman et al. 2013, 151) a u-value can be averaged over \\(\\theta\\), but it is not Bayesian, and is not a probability distribution posterior p-value: probability statement, conditional on model and data, about future observations 5.2.4 Marginal predictive checks Compare statistics for each observation. Conditional Predictive Ordinate (CPO): The CPO (Gelfand 1996) is the leave-on-out cross-validation predictive density: \\[ p(y_i | y_{-i}) = \\int p(y_i | \\theta) p(\\theta | y_{-i}) d\\,\\theta \\] The pointwise predicted LOO probabilities can be calculated using PSIS-LOO or WAIC in the loo package. Predictive Concordance and Predictive QuantilesP Gelfand (1996) classifies any \\(y_i\\) that is outside the central 95% predictive posterior of \\(y^{rep}_i\\) is an outlier. Let the predictive quantile (\\(PQ_i\\)) be \\[ PQ_i = p(y_i^{(rep)} &gt; y_i) . \\] Then the predictive concordance be the proportion of \\(y_i\\) that are not outliers. Gelfand (1996) argues that the predictive concordance should match 95% - in other words that the posterior predictive distribution should have the correct coverage. (Laplace Demon p. 20) 5.2.5 Outliers Can be identified by the inverse-CPO. larger than 40 are possible outliers, and those higher than 70 are extreme values (Ntzoufras 2009, p. 376). Congdon (2005) scales CPO by dividing each by its individual max and considers observations with scaled CPO under 0.01 as outliers. 5.2.6 Grapical Posterior Predictive Checks Visualization can surprise you, but it doesn’t scale well. Modeling scales well, but it can’t surprise you. – paraphrase of Hadley Hickham Instead of calculating posterior probabilities, plot simulated data and observed data and visually compare them. See Gelman et al. (2013, 154). plot simulated data and real data (Gelman et al. 2013, 154). This is similar to ideas in Wickham et al. (2010). plot summary statistics or inferences residual plots Bayesian residuals have a distribution \\(r_i^{(s)} = y_i - \\E(y_i | \\theta^{s})\\) Bayesian resdiual graph plots single realization of the residuals, or a summary of their posterior distributions binned plots are best for discrete data (Gelman et al. 2013, 157) 5.3 Sources See Gelman and Shalizi (2012b), Gelman and Shalizi (2012a), Kruschke (2013) "],

Let’s run the regression of occupational prestige on the type of occupation, income, and education: \\[ \\begin{multline} y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I(\\mathtt{type} = \\mathtt{&quot;prof&quot;}) + \\beta_2 I(\\mathtt{type} = \\mathtt{&quot;wc&quot;}) \\\\ + \\beta_3 \\mathtt{income} + \\beta_4 \\mathtt{education} + \\epsilon_i \\end{multline} \\] duncan_lm &lt;- lm(prestige ~ type + income + education, data = Duncan) duncan_lm #&gt; #&gt; Call: #&gt; lm(formula = prestige ~ type + income + education, data = Duncan) #&gt; #&gt; Coefficients: #&gt; (Intercept) typeprof typewc income education #&gt; -0.185 16.658 -14.661 0.598 0.345 There are \\(n = 45\\) observations in the dataset. Let \\(y\\) be a \\(n \\times 1\\) vector of the values of prestige. Let \\(X\\) be the \\(n \\times k\\) design matrix of the regression. In this case, \\(k = 5\\), \\[ X = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \\mathtt{typeprof} &amp; \\mathtt{typewc} &amp; \\mathtt{income} &amp; \\mathtt{education} \\end{bmatrix} \\] In OLS, we get the frequentist estimates of \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) by minimizing the squared errors, \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} = \\argmin_{\\beta} \\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \\beta&#39; x_i)^2 = \\argmin \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\hat{\\epsilon}_i \\] For valid inference we need to make assumptions about \\(\\epsilon_i\\), namely that they are uncorrelated with \\(X\\), \\(\\Cov(\\epsilon, X) = 0\\), and that they are i.i.d, \\(\\Cov(\\epsilon_i, \\epsilon_j) = 0\\), \\(\\Var(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2\\) for all \\(i\\). However, no specific distributional form is or needs to be assumed for \\(\\epsilon\\) since CLT results show that, asymptotically, the sampling distribution of \\(\\beta\\) is distributed normal. Additionally, although \\(\\hat\\sigma^2 = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\epsilon_i / (n - k - 1)\\) is a estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\), standard errors of the standard error of the regression are not directly provided. In Bayesian inference, our target is the posterior distribution of the parameters, \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\): \\(p(\\beta, \\sigma^2 | y, X)\\). Since all uncertainty in Bayesian inference is provided via probability, we will need to explicitly provide parametric distributions for the likelihood and parameters. \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X) \\propto p(y | \\beta, \\sigma) p(\\beta, \\sigma) \\] For a Bayesian linear regression model, we’ll need to specify distributions for \\(p(y | \\beta, \\sigma)\\) and \\(p(\\beta, \\sigma)\\). Likelihood: \\(p(y_i | x_i, \\beta, \\sigma)\\) suppose that the observations are distributed independent normal: \\[ y_i \\sim N(\\beta&#39;x_i, \\sigma^2) \\] Priors: The model needs to specify a prior distribution for the parameters \\((\\beta, \\sigma)\\). Rather than specify a single distribution for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), it will be easier to specify independent (separate) distributions for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). The Stan manual and … provide For the normal distribution, assume i.i.d. normal distributions for each element of \\(\\beta\\): \\[ \\beta_k \\sim N(b, s) \\] For the scale parameter of the normal distribution, \\(\\sigma\\), we will use a half-Cauchy. The Cauchy distribution is a special case of the Student t distribution when the degrees of freedom is 1. In Bayesian stats, it has the property that it concentrates probability mass around its median (zero), but has very wide tails, so if the prior distribution guess is wrong, the parameter can still adapt to data. A half-Cauchy distribution is a Cauchy distribution but with support of \\((0, \\infty)\\) instead of the entire real line. \\[ \\sigma \\sim C^{+}(0, w) \\] Combining all the previous equations, our statistical model for linear regression is, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y &amp;\\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\ \\mu &amp;= X \\beta \\\\ \\beta &amp;\\sim N(b, s) \\\\ \\sigma &amp;\\sim C^{+}(0, w) \\end{aligned} \\] This defines a Bayesian model gives us \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X, b, s, w) \\propto p(y | X, \\beta) p(\\beta | b, s) p(\\sigma | w) \\] The targets of inference in this model are the two parameters: \\(\\beta\\) (regression coefficients), and \\(\\sigma\\) (standard deviation of the regression). This is conditional on the observed or assumed quantities, which including both the data \\(y\\) (response) and \\(X\\) (predictors), as well the values defining the prior distributions: \\(b\\), \\(s\\), and \\(w\\). Now that we’ve defined a statistical model, we can write it as a Stan model. Stan models are written in its own domain-specific language that focuses on declaring the statistical model (parameters, variables, distributions) while leaving the details of the sampling algorithm to Stan. A Stan model consists of blocks which contain declarations of variables and/or statements. Each block has a specific purpose in the model. functions { // OPTIONAL: user-defined functions } data { // read in data ... } transformed data { // Create new variables/auxiliary variables from the data } parameters { // Declare parameters that will be estimated } transformed parameters { // Create new variables/auxiliary variables from the parameters } model { // Declare your probability model: priors, hyperpriors &amp; likelihood } generated quantities { // Declare any quantities other than simulated parameters to be generated } The file lm.stan is a Stan model for the linear regression model previously defined. data { // number of observations int n; // response vector vector[n] y; // number of columns in the design matrix X int k; // design matrix X matrix [n, k] X; // beta prior real b_loc; real&lt;lower = 0.0&gt; b_scale; // sigma prior real sigma_scale; } parameters { // regression coefficient vector vector[k] b; // scale of the regression errors real&lt;lower = 0.0&gt; sigma; } transformed parameters { // mu is the observation fitted/predicted value // also called yhat vector[n] mu; mu = a + X * b; } model { // priors b ~ normal(b_loc, b_scale); sigma ~ cauchy(0, sigma_scale); // likelihood y ~ normal(mu, sigma); } generated quantities { // simulate data from the posterior vector[n] y_rep; for (i in 1:n) { y_rep[i] = normal_rng(mu[i], sigma); } } mod1 &lt;- stan_model(&quot;stan/lm.stan&quot;) mod1 prelist()list(list(name = “code”, attribs = list(class = “stan”), children = list(“data {// number of observationsint n;// response vectorvector[n] y;// number of columns in the design matrix Xint k;// design matrix Xmatrix [n, k] X;// beta priorreal b_loc;real b_scale;// sigma priorreal sigma_scale;}parameters {// mu is the observation fitted/predicted value// also called yhatvector[n] mu;mu = X * b;}quantities {// simulate data from the posteriorvector[n] y_rep;for (i in 1:n) {y_rep[i] = normal_rng(mu[i], sigma);}}”))) See the Stan Modeling Language User’s Guide and Reference Manual for details of the Stan Language. NoteSince a Stan model compiles to C++ code, you may receive some warning messages such as /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/library/StanHeaders/include/stan/math/rev/core/set_zero_all_adjoints.hpp:14:17: warning: unused function &#39;set_zero_all_adjoints&#39; [-Wunused-function] static void set_zero_all_adjoints() { ^ In file included from file1d4a4d50faa.cpp:8: In file included from /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/library/StanHeaders/include/src/stan/model/model_header.hpp:4: As long as your model compiles, you can ignore these compiler warnings (On the other hard, warnings that occur during sampling should not be ignored). If the Stan model does not give you a syntax error when parsing the model, it should compile to valid C++.[^bugs][^c-warnings] See [bugs]: In the rare case that the Stan parser transpiles the Stan model to C++ but cannot compile the C++ code, it is a bug in Stan. Follow the instructions on how to inform the Stan developers about bugs. [c-warnings]: The extended installation instructions for MacOS/Linux and Windows have instructions for adding compiler options to the R Makevars file. 6.2.1 Sampling In order to sample from the model, we need to at least give it the values for the data to use: n, k, y, X, and the data associated with the priors. mod1_data &lt;- list( y = Duncan$prestige, n = nrow(Duncan) ) The data types in Stan are all numeric (either integers or reals), but they include matrices and vectors. However, there is nothing like a data frame in Stan. Whereas in the R function lm we can provide a formula and a data set for where to look for objects, and the function will create the appropriate \\(X\\) matrix for the regression, we will need to create that matrix ourselves—expanding categorical variables to indicator variables, and expanding interactions and other functions of the predictors. However, we need to do that all manually. The function stats is the workhorse function used in lm and many other R functions to convert a formula into the matrix used in estimation. X &lt;- model.matrix(prestige ~ type + income + education, data = Duncan) mod1_data$X &lt;- X mod1_data$k &lt;- ncol(X) We still need to provide the values for the prior distributions. For specific values of the prior distributions, assume uninformative priors for beta by setting the mean to zero and the variances to large numbers. \\[ \\beta_k \\sim N(0, 1000) \\] mod1_data$b_loc &lt;- 0 mod1_data$b_scale &lt;- 1000 For prior of the regression scale parameter \\(\\sigma\\), use a half-Cauchy distribution with a large scale parameter, which is a good choice for the priors of scale parameters. \\[ \\sigma \\sim C^{+}(0, 50) \\] mod1_data$sigma_scale &lt;- 50 Now, sample from the posterior, using the function sampling: mod1_fit &lt;- sampling(mod1, data = mod1_data) 6.2.2 Convergence Diagnostics and Model Fit Convergence Diagnostics: Is this the posterior distribution that you were looking for? These don’t directly say anything about how “good” the model is in terms representing the data, they are only evaluating how well the sampler is doing at sampling the posterior distribution of the given model. If there are problems with these, then the sample results do not represent the posterior distribution, and your inferences will be biased. mcse: n_eff: Rhat divergences Model fit: Is this statistical model appropriate for the data?

The normal distribution has narrow tail probabilities. This plots the normal, Double Exponential (Laplace), and Student-t (df = 4) distributions all with mean 0 and scale 1, and the surprise (\\(- log(p)\\)) at each point. Higher surprise is a lower log-likelihood. Both the Student-t and Double Exponential distributions have surprise values well below the normal in the ranges (-6, 6).3 This means that outliers impose less of a penalty on the log-posterior models using these distributions, and the regression line would need to move less to incorporate those observations since the error distribution will not consider them as unusual. z &lt;- seq(-6, 6, length.out = 100) bind_rows( tibble(z = z, p = dnorm(z, 0, 1), distr = &quot;Normal&quot;), tibble(z = z, p = dt(z, 4), distr = &quot;Student-t (df = 4)&quot;), tibble(z = z, p = VGAM::dlaplace(z, 0, 1), distr = &quot;Double Exponential&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(`-log(p)` = -log(p)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = z, y = `-log(p)`, colour = distr)) + geom_line() z &lt;- seq(-6, 6, length.out = 100) bind_rows( tibble(z = z, p = dnorm(z, 0, 1), distr = &quot;Normal&quot;), tibble(z = z, p = dt(z, 4), distr = &quot;Student-t (df = 4)&quot;), tibble(z = z, p = VGAM::dlaplace(z, 0, 1), distr = &quot;Double Exponential&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(`-log(p)` = -log(p)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = z, y = p, colour = distr)) + geom_line() mod_t prelist()list(list(name = “code”, attribs = list(class = “stan”), children = list(“data {// number of observationsint n;// response vectorvector[n] y;// number of columns in the design matrix Xint k;// design matrix Xmatrix [n, k] X;// beta priorreal b_loc;real b_scale;// sigma priorreal sigma_scale;}parameters {// mu is the observation fitted/predicted value// also called yhatvector[n] mu;mu = X * b;}quantities {// simulate data from the posteriorvector[n] y_rep;// log-likelihood valuesvector[n] log_lik;for (i in 1:n) {y_rep[i] = student_t_rng(nu, mu[i], sigma);log_lik[i] = student_t_lpdf(y[i] | nu, mu[i], sigma);}}”))) unionization &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;data/western1995/unionization.tsv&quot;, col_types = cols( country = col_character(), union_density = col_double(), left_government = col_double(), labor_force_size = col_number(), econ_conc = col_double() )) mod_data &lt;- preprocess_lm(union_density ~ left_government + log(labor_force_size) + econ_conc, data = unionization) mod_data &lt;- within(mod_data, { b_loc &lt;- 0 b_scale &lt;- 1000 sigma_scale &lt;- sd(y) }) The max_treedepth parameter needed to be increased because in some runs it was hitting the maximum tree depth.

However, there is straightforwardly direct translation of HC standard error to regression model this in a Bayesian setting. The sandwich method of estimating HC errors uses the same point estimates for the regression coefficients as OLS, but estimates the standard errors of those coefficients in a second stage from the OLS residuals. Disregarding differences in frequentist vs. Bayesian inference, it is clear that a direct translation of that method could not be fully Bayesian since the coefficients and errors are not estimated jointly. In a linear normal regression model with heteroskedasticity, each observation has its own scale parameter, \\(\\sigma_i\\), \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y_i &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(X \\beta, \\sigma_i) . \\end{aligned} \\] It should be clear that without proper priors this model is not identified, meaning that the posterior distribution is improper. To estimate this model we have to apply some model to the scale terms, \\(\\sigma_i\\). In fact, you can think of homoskedasticity as the simplest such model; assuming that all \\(\\sigma_i = \\sigma\\). A more general model of \\(\\sigma_i\\) should encode any information the analyst has about the scale terms. This can be a distribution or functions of covariates for how we think observations may have different values. 7.3.1 Covariates A simple model of heteroskedasticity is if the observations can be split into groups. Suppose the observations are partitioned into \\(k = 1, \\dots, K\\) groups, and \\(k[i]\\) is the group of observation \\(i\\), \\[ \\sigma_i = \\sigma_{k[i]} \\] Another choice would be to model the scale term with a regression model, for example, \\[ \\log(\\sigma_i) \\sim \\dnorm(X \\gamma, \\tau) \\] 7.3.2 Student-t Error The Student-t distribution of error terms from the Robust Regression chapter is also model of heteroskedasticity. A reparameterization that will be used quite often is to rewrite a normal distributions with unequal scale parameters as the product of a common global scale parameter (\\(\\sigma\\)), and observation specific local scale parameters, \\(\\lambda_i\\),[^globalmixture] \\[ y_i \\sim \\dnorm(X\\beta, \\lambda_i \\sigma) . \\] If the local variance parameters are distributed inverse-gamma, \\[ \\lambda^2 \\sim \\dinvgamma(\\nu / 2, \\nu / 2) \\] then the above is equivalent to a regression with errors distributed Student-t errors with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom, \\[ y_i \\sim \\dt{\\nu}(X \\beta, \\sigma) . \\] [^globalmixture] See this for a visualization of a Student-t distribution a mixture of Normal distributions, and this for a derivation of the Student t distribution as a mixture of normal distributions. This scale mixture of normal representation will also be used with shrinkage priors on the regression coefficients. Example: Simulate Student-t distribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom as a scale mixture of normal. For *s in 1:S$, Simulate \\(z_s \\sim \\dgamma(\\nu / 2, \\nu / 2)\\) \\(x_s = 1 / \\sqrt{z_s}2\\) is draw from \\(\\dt{\\nu}(0, 1)\\). When using R, ensure that you are using the correct parameterization of the gamma distribution. Left to reader 7.4 References 7.4.1 Robust regression See Gelman and Hill (2007 sec 6.6), Gelman et al.

A GLM consists of three components: A probability distribution (family) specifying the conditional distribution of the response variable. In GLMs, the distribution is in the exponential family: Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Categorical, Multinomial, Poisson, Beta. A linear predictor, which is a linear function of the predictors, \\[ \\eta = \\mat{X} \\vec{\\beta} . \\] A link function (\\(g(.)\\)) which maps the expected value to the the linear predictor, \\[ g(\\mu) = \\eta . \\] The link function is smooth and invertible, and the inverse link function or mean function maps the linear predictor to the mean, \\[ \\mu = g^{-1}(\\eta) . \\] The link function (\\(g\\)) and its inverse ($g^{-1}) translate \\(\\eta\\) from \\((\\-infty, +\\infty)\\) to the proper range for the probability distribution and back again. These models are often estimated with MLE, as with the function stats. However, these are also easily estimated in a Bayesian setting. See the help for stats for common probability distributions, stats for common links, and the Wikipedia page for a table of common GLMs. See the function VGAM for even more examples of link functions and probability distributions.

This implementation is for numeric stability. 8.2.1 Example: Vote Turnout A general Stan model for estimating logit models is: mod1 prelist()list(list(name = “code”, attribs = list(class = “stan”), children = list(“// Logit Model//// y ~ Bernoulli(p)// p = a + X B// b0 \\sim cauchy(0, 10)// b \\sim cauchy(0, 2.5)parameters {vector[N] p;p = inv_logit(b0 + X * b);}quantities {// simulate data from the posteriorvector[N] y_rep;// log-likelihood posteriorvector[N] log_lik;for (i in 1:N) {y_rep[i] = binomial_rng(1, p[i]);log_lik[i] = binomial_lpmf(y[i] | 1, p[i]);}}”))) This uses the default semi-informative priors in Gelman 2008 … Estimate a model of vote turnout in the 1992 from the American National Election Survey (ANES). The data is from Zelig.5 data(&quot;turnout&quot;, package = &quot;Zelig&quot;) Vote choice (vote) is modeled as a function of age, income, and race. mod_formula &lt;- vote ~ poly(age, 2) + income + educate + race - 1 mod1_data &lt;- lm_preprocess(mod_formula, data = turnout) 8.2.2 Extensions Separation: Rare events: 8.2.3 Perfect Separation Firth (1993) proposes a penalized likelihood approach using the Jeffreys invariant prior King and Zeng (2001a) and King and Zeng (2001b) apply an approach similar to the penalized likelihood approach for the similar problem of rare events Zorn (2005) also suggests using the Firth logistic regression to avoid perfect separation Rainey (2016a) shows that Cauchy(0, 2.5) priors can be used Greenland and Mansournia (2015) provide another default prior to for binomial models: log F(1,1) and log F(2, 2) priors. These have the nice property that they are interpretable as additional observations. 8.2.4 References Stan Development Team (2016 Sec. 8.5) McElreath (2016 Ch 10) Gelman and Hill (2007) [Ch. 5; Sec 6.4-6.5] Fox (2016 Ch. 14) Gelman et al. (2013 Ch. 16) 8.3 Count Models 8.3.1 Poisson The Poisson model is used for unbounded count data, \\[ Y = 0, 1, \\dots, \\infty \\] The outcome is modeled as a Poisson distribution \\[ y_i \\sim \\dpois(\\lambda_i) \\] with positive mean parameter \\(\\lambda_i \\in (0, \\infty)\\). Since \\(\\lambda_i\\) has to be positive, the most common link function is the log, \\[ \\log(\\lambda_i) = \\exp(\\vec{x}_i&#39; \\vec{\\beta}) \\] which has the inverse, \\[ \\lambda_i = \\log(\\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\beta}) \\] In Stan, the Poisson distribution has two implementations: poisson_lpdf poisson_log_lpdf: Poisson with a log link. This is for numeric stability. Also, rstanarm supports the Poisson. 8.3.2 References Gelman and Hill (2007, 109–16) McElreath (2016 Ch 10) Fox (2016 Ch. 14) Gelman et al. (2013 Ch. 16) 8.4 Negative Binomial The Negative Binomial model is also used for unbounded count data, \\[ Y = 0, 1, \\dots, \\infty \\] The Poisson distribution has the restriction that the mean is equal to the variance, \\(\\E(X) = \\Var(X) = \\lambda\\). The Negative Binomial distribution has an additional parameter that allows the variance to vary (though it is always larger than the mean). The outcome is modeled as a negative binomial distribution, \\[ y_i \\sim \\dnbinom(\\alpha_i, \\beta) \\] with shape \\(\\alpha \\in \\R^{+}\\) and inverse scale \\(\\beta \\in \\R^{+}\\), and \\(\\E(y) = \\alpha_i / \\beta\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\frac{\\alpha_i}{\\beta^2}(\\beta + 1)\\). Then the mean can be modeled and transformed to the \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\mu_i &amp;= \\log( \\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\gamma} ) \\\\ \\alpha_i &amp;= \\mu_i / \\beta \\end{aligned} \\] Important The negative binomial distribution has many different parameterizations. An alternative parameterization of the negative binomial uses the mean and a over-dispersion parameter. \\[ y_i \\sim \\dnbinomalt(\\mu_i, \\phi) \\] with location parameter \\(\\mu \\in \\R^{+}\\) and over-dispersion parameter \\(\\phi \\in \\R^{+}\\), and \\(\\E(y) = \\mu_i\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\mu_i + \\frac{\\mu_i^2}{\\phi}\\). Then the mean can be modeled and transformed to the \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\mu_i &amp;= \\log( \\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\gamma} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] In Stan, there are multiple parameterizations of the neg_binomial_lpdf(y | alpha, beta)with shape parameter alpha and inverse scale parameter beta. neg_binomial_2_lpdf(y | mu, phi) with mean mu and over-dispersion parameter phi. neg_binomial_2_log_lpdf(y | eta, phi) with log-mean eta and over-dispersion parameter phi Also, rstanarm supports Poisson and negative binomial models. Gelman et al. (2013 Ch 16) 8.4.1 Multinomial / Categorical Models 8.5 Gamma Regression The response variable is continuous and positive. In gamma regression, the coefficient of variation is constant rather than the variance. \\[ y_i \\sim \\dgamma(\\alpha_i, \\beta) \\] and \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\alpha_i &amp;= \\mu_i / \\beta \\\\ \\mu_i &amp;= \\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\gamma} \\end{aligned} \\] In Stan, gamma(y | alpha, beta) with shape parameter \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\) and inverse scale parameter \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\). Then \\(\\E(Y) = \\alpha / \\beta\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\alpha / \\beta^2\\). 8.6 Beta Regression This is for a response variable that is a proportion, \\(y_i \\in (0, 1)\\), \\[ y_i \\sim \\dbeta(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i) \\] and \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\mu_i &amp;= g^{-1}(\\vec{x}_i&#39; \\vec{\\gamma}) \\\\ \\alpha_i &amp;= \\mu_i \\phi \\\\ \\beta_i &amp;= (1 - \\mu_i) \\phi \\end{aligned} \\] Additionally, the \\(\\phi\\) parameter could also be modeled. In Stan: beta(y | alpha, beta) with positive prior successes plus one, \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), and negative prior failures plus one, \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\). Then \\(\\E(Y) = \\alpha / (\\alpha + \\beta)\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\alpha\\beta / ((\\alpha + \\beta)^2 (\\alpha + \\beta + 1))\\). rstanarm function rstasnarm See: Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004), Cribari-Neto and Zeileis (2010), and Grün, Kosmidis, and Zeileis (2012) on beta regression. rstanarm documentation Modeling Rates/Proportions using Beta Regression with rstanarm 8.7 Ordered Logistic rstanarm function rstasnarm Gelman and Hill (2007 Ch 6.5) *rstanarm** vignette Estimating Ordinal Regression Models with rstanarm 8.8 References Texts: Gelman et al.

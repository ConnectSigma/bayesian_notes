["bayesian-inference.html", "1 Bayesian Inference 1.1 Bayesian Analysis 1.2 Posterior Predictive Distribution", " 1 Bayesian Inference new shit has come to light, man – The Dude (The Big Lebowski) Statistical inference is the process of using observed data to infer properties of the statistical distributions that generated that data. Bayesian inference is the process of fitting a probability model to a set of data and summarizing the result by a probability distribution on the parameters of the model and on unobserved quantities such as predictions for new observations. The motivation of statistical inference is the learn about unknown quantities (parameters) of a process from data that was generated by it. In other words, the quantity of interest in statistical inference is \\[ \\Pr(\\text{parameters} | \\text{data}) . \\] This conditional distribution is called the posterior distribution. Bayesian inference answers this question by appealing to Bayes’ Theorem, \\[ \\underbrace{\\Pr(\\text{parameters} | \\text{data})}_{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\Pr(\\text{data} | \\text{parameters})}^{\\text{likelihood}} \\overbrace{\\Pr(\\text{parameters})}^{\\text{prior}}}{\\underbrace{\\Pr(\\text{data})}_{evidence}} . \\] The remainder of these notes discusses how to apply this to problems. 1.1 Bayesian Analysis The three steps of Bayesian analysis (A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, 3) are Modeling: define a full probability model which incorporates all observable and unobservable quantities of the problem. To the extent possible, the model should incorporate all relevant data about the underlying problem and data generating problem. Estimation: given data, estimate the parameters for the posterior distribution defined in the modeling step. Evaluation: given the posterior distribution, evaluate the fit the model to the data, or the prediction of new data. If it is insufficient, go back to step one. One of the nice features of Bayesian analysis is that in theory it clearly separates the modeling step from the estimation step. However, in application, the difficulties of computing the posterior distribution have meant that the computational and modeling steps have often been tightly coupled. Yet, new algorithms, improvements in computational capacity, and new software have started to make it possible to black-box the estimation stage. 1.2 Posterior Predictive Distribution The posterior predictive distribution is the the probability of observing new data (\\(y^{eval}\\)) given the posterior distribution of the model parameters after observing training data, \\(p(\\theta | y^{train})\\). \\[ p(y^{eval} | y^{train}) = \\int p(y^{eval} | \\theta) p(\\theta | y^{train})\\,d \\theta . \\tag{1.1} \\] Many tradition statistical or machine learning methods proceed by estimating a “best” value of the parameters using training data, and then predicting evaluating data using that parameter. For example, we could calculate the maximum a posteriori estimate of of \\(\\theta\\) given the training data, \\[ \\hat{\\theta} = \\arg \\max_{\\theta} p(\\theta | y^{train}) , \\] and then use that for the distribution of evaluation data, \\[ p(y^{eval} | y^{train} \\approx p(y^{eval} | \\hat{\\theta}) . \\] However, this does not incorporate the uncertainty in the estimates of \\(\\theta\\). The full form of the posterior predictive distribution in Equation \\tag{1.1} incorporates the uncertainty about \\(\\theta\\) into the distribution of \\(p(y^{eval} | \\theta)\\). "],
["bayes-theorem.html", "2 Bayes Theorem Prerequisites 2.1 Introduction to Bayes’ Theorem 2.2 Examples 2.3 Why most research findings are false 2.4 Measurement Error and Rare Events in Surveys", " 2 Bayes Theorem This document contains a discussion and several examples of Bayes’ Theorem. Prerequisites library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(&quot;babynames&quot;) 2.1 Introduction to Bayes’ Theorem For events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\[ \\underbrace{\\Pr(A | B)}_{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\Pr(B | A)}^{\\text{likelihood}} \\overbrace{\\Pr(A)}^{\\text{prior}}}{\\underbrace{\\Pr(B)}_{\\text{marginal likelihood}}}, \\] where \\(\\Pr(B) \\neq 0\\). For discrete random variables \\(X\\) which takes values in the set \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(Y\\) which takes values in the set \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\), Bayes’ Theorem can be written as, \\[ p_{Y|X}(X = x|Y = y) = \\frac{p_{Y|X}(Y = y|X = x) p_X(X = x)}{p_Y(Y = y)} = \\frac{p_{Y|X}(Y = y|X = x) p_X(X = x)}{\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{x}} p_{Y|X}(Y = y|X = x) p_X(X = x)} \\] For continuous random variables \\(X\\) with support \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with support \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\), Bayes’ Theorem can be written as, \\[ p_{Y|X}(x|Y = y) = \\frac{p_{Y|X = x}(y) p_X(x)}{p_Y(y)} = \\frac{p_{Y|X = x}(y) p_X(x)}{\\int_{x \\in \\mathcal{x}} p_{Y|X = x}(y) p_X(x) dx} \\] Though there are deeper differences between discrete and continuous probability theory, the primary difference in the equations for Bayes’ Theorem with discrete or continuous random variables is whether summation or integration is used to calculate the marginal likelihood. 2.2 Examples 2.2.1 Taxi-Cab Problem Suppose you were told that a taxi-cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident one night. Of the taxi-cabs in the city, 85% belonged to the Green company and 15% to the Blue company. You are then asked to estimate the likelihood that the hit-and-run accident involved a green taxi-cab (all else being equal).1 What is the probability that the taxi-cab involved in the hit and run is blue? It is 85%, since we have no other information. You are then told that an eyewitness had identified the cab as a blue cab. But when her ability to identify cabs under appropriate visibility conditions was tested, she was wrong 20% of the time. What is the probability that the cab is blue? Let \\(H_B\\) (\\(H_G\\)) be the event that a blue (green) cab committed the hit and run. Let \\(W_B\\) (\\(W_G\\)) be the event that the witness reported that a blue (green) cab committed the hit and run. We are interested in \\(\\Pr(H_B | W_B)\\), the probability that a blue cab committed the hit and run given that the witness reported a blue cab committing the hit and run. \\[ \\Pr(H_B | W_B) = \\frac{\\Pr(W_B | H_B) \\Pr(H_B)}{\\Pr(W_B)} = \\frac{\\Pr(W_B | H_B) \\Pr(H_B)}{\\Pr(W_B | H_B) \\Pr(H_B) + \\Pr(W_B | H_G) \\Pr(H_G)}. \\] The prior probabilities of the color of the cab come are the proportions of cabs in the city, \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr(H_B) &amp;= 0.15 ,\\\\ \\Pr(H_G) &amp;= 0.85 . \\end{aligned} \\] The conditional probabilities are, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(W_B | H_B) &amp;= 0.8 , \\\\ p(W_B | H_G) &amp;= 0.2 . \\end{aligned} \\] The marginal likelihood (model evidence) is the overall probability that a cab is reported to be blue. This considers both the probabilities that a witness reports that the cab is blue when it is blue and reports that it is blue when it is green. \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\Pr(W_B) = \\Pr(W_B | H_B) \\Pr(H_B) + \\Pr(W_B | H_B) \\Pr(H_B) \\end{aligned} \\] To calculate the posterior distribution, put the prior and likelihoods into a table. cabs &lt;- tribble( ~ color, ~ prior, ~ likelihood, &quot;blue&quot;, 0.15, 0.8, &quot;green&quot;, 0.85, 0.2 ) Calculate the marginal probability. cabs %&gt;% mutate( marginal = sum(likelihood * prior), posterior = likelihood * prior / marginal ) #&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 5 #&gt; color prior likelihood marginal posterior #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 blue 0.15 0.8 0.29 0.414 #&gt; 2 green 0.85 0.2 0.29 0.586 Suppose that you know that all cabs in the city are blue or green, but you don’t know the proportions of them. You use the principle of indifference to assign prior probabilities of, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(H_B) = p(H_G) = 0.5 . \\end{aligned} \\] Suppose the witness reports that a blue cab hit the citizen, what is the probability that the cab committing the hit and run was blue. A common answer to this question is “blue”. This mistake is often due to ignoring the prior probability of an event, and interpreting \\(P(H_B | W_B) = P(W_B | H_B)\\). This is called the base-rate fallacy? What prior does the base-rate fallacy correspond to? In other words, what prior is needed such that \\(\\Pr(H_B | W_B) = \\Pr(W_B | H_B)\\). Suppose that there was was perfectly reliable video evidence of the hit and run, such that \\(\\Pr(W_B | H_B) = 1\\) and \\(\\Pr(W_B | H_G) = 0\\). What is the probability that the cab committing the hit and run was blue? Suppose that the witness reports that the cab was “yellow”. You know that there are no yellow cabs in the city, thus \\(\\Pr(H_Y) = 0\\). What is the probability that the cab committing the hit and run was yellow, given that the witness reports it being yellow? What level of accuracy would you require from the witness such that you believed that the cab committing the hit and run was yellow. What level of accuracy would be required from the witness such that it is more probable that a green cab committed the hit and run than a blue cab? There have been various proposals to quantify what is meant by “beyond a reasonable doubt”. But for the purpose of this question, let’s suppose that beyond a reasonable doubt is a probability greater or equal to 0.8. What level of accuracy is required from the witness to meet the reasonable doubt standard? 2.3 Why most research findings are false Consider this simplified mode of scientific research. Let \\(H\\) (\\(\\lnot H\\)) be the event that a hypothesis is true (false). Let \\(D\\) (\\(\\lnot D\\)) be the result of a hypothesis test of \\(H\\).2 Suppose that the test uses statistical significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) Since statistical significance controls the presence of type I error, \\[ P(H | \\lnot D) = \\alpha = 0.05 \\] alpha &lt;- 0.05 Suppose that the test uses a power level of \\(\\beta = 0.8\\). Since power is \\(1 - \\Pr(\\text{Type II error})\\), \\[ \\Pr(H | D) = \\beta = 0.8 \\] beta &lt;- 0.8 Given that information, suppose that you observe \\(D\\). Can you calculate \\(\\Pr(H | D)\\)? No. By Bayes’ Theorem, \\[ \\Pr(H | D) = \\frac{\\Pr(D | H) \\Pr(H)}{\\Pr(D)} \\] We cannot calculate this because we do not know \\(\\Pr(H)\\). Suppose that a priori, many hypotheses are false. We will set \\(\\Pr(H)\\) to the following value, but will explore how the posterior changes with respect to different values of it. \\[ \\Pr(H) = 0.1 . \\] With this information we can calculate \\[ \\Pr(H | D) = \\frac{\\Pr(D | H) \\Pr(H)}{\\Pr(D | H) \\Pr(H) + \\Pr(D | \\lnot H) \\Pr(\\lnot H)} \\] p_theta &lt;- 0.1 science &lt;- tribble( ~ theta, ~ x, ~ prior, ~ likelihood, TRUE, TRUE, p_theta, beta, TRUE, FALSE, p_theta, 1 - beta, FALSE, TRUE, 1 - p_theta, alpha, FALSE, FALSE, 1 - p_theta, 1 - alpha ) Calculate the posterior probability for each value of theta, for the different cases of x: group_by(science, x) %&gt;% mutate(marginal = sum(likelihood * prior), posterior = likelihood * prior / marginal ) %&gt;% arrange(x) #&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 6 #&gt; # Groups: x [2] #&gt; theta x prior likelihood marginal posterior #&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 TRUE FALSE 0.1 0.200 0.875 0.0229 #&gt; 2 FALSE FALSE 0.9 0.95 0.875 0.977 #&gt; 3 TRUE TRUE 0.1 0.8 0.125 0.64 #&gt; 4 FALSE TRUE 0.9 0.05 0.125 0.36 2.3.1 Questions \\(p\\)-value hacking is a process by which a research ensures that their test has a statistically significant result? What term does this affect? If you know a study was p-value hacked, what is the posterior distribution Suppose a paper finds support for a novel and counter-intuitive theory. What parameter would that affect? Would it result in a higher or lower posterior probability? Suppose a paper conducts a test of a well-established theory. What parameter would that affect? Would it result in a higher or lower posterior probability? There are some arguments that the \\(p\\)-value threshold should be reduced to \\(\\alpha = 0.005\\). What is the posterior probability of \\(\\Pr(H | D)\\) in that case? Given the other parameters, what value of \\(\\alpha\\) would you need so that \\(\\Pr(H | D) \\geq 0.95\\) ? Many studies are under-powered. For example, this paper finds that empirically, many neuroscience experiments have powers of 8% to 31%. Suppose that the experiment has a power of 20%. What is the posterior probability \\(\\Pr(H | D)\\)? Given the other parameters, what value of \\(\\beta\\) would you need so that \\(\\Pr(H | D) \\geq 0.95\\) ? Given the original parameters, how many times would you have to replicate a study to get \\(P(H | D_1, \\dots, D_k) \\geq 0.95\\)? Suppose you run a study twice. Does \\(P(H | D_1, \\lnot D_2) = P(H | D_1, \\lnot D_2)\\)? In other words, does the order in which evidence is received matter? A study produces a statistically significant result, with a \\(p\\)-value of 0.01. The PI explains the results to the press saying that there is only a 1% chance that the findings are false. Is that interpretation of the p-value correct? If not, why not? Calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence between \\[ KL(\\Pr(H|D) || \\Pr(H)) = \\sum \\Pr(H | D) \\log \\frac{\\Pr(H | D)} \\] Which event has more information, \\(D\\) or \\(\\lnot D\\)? 2.4 Measurement Error and Rare Events in Surveys Suppose a survey includes 20,000 respondents.3 Of them 19,500 are citizens and 500 are not. Suppose that 99.9% of the time, the survey question response is correct (citizens respond that they are citizens, and non-citizens respond that they are non-citizens). The survey against voting records, which provides the estimate \\(P(v = 1 | c = 0) = 0.7\\) What is the probability of being a non-citizen given that a person reported being a non-citizen? sample_size &lt;- 20000 non_citizens &lt;- 500 p_non_citizen &lt;- non_citizens / 20000 accuracy &lt;- 0.999 prior_citizen &lt;- 0.5 tribble( ~ citizen_reported, ~ citizen, ~ prior, ~ likelihood, TRUE, TRUE, prior_citizen, accuracy, TRUE, FALSE, prior_citizen, 1 - accuracy, FALSE, TRUE, 1 - prior_citizen, accuracy, FALSE, FALSE, 1 - prior_citizen, 1 - accuracy ) #&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 4 #&gt; citizen_reported citizen prior likelihood #&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 TRUE TRUE 0.5 0.999 #&gt; 2 TRUE FALSE 0.5 0.001 #&gt; 3 FALSE TRUE 0.5 0.999 #&gt; 4 FALSE FALSE 0.5 0.001 Given a respondent responded that they were a non-citizen, what is the probability that they are actually a non-citizen? How many citizens do you expect to respond that they are non-citizens? How many non-citizens do you expect to respond that they are citizens? Is the prior reasonable? How would you choose a better prior? How much would it affect the results? Suppose that citizens vote with 70% probability, and non-citizens never vote. With these assumptions, what is the probability that they are a non-citizen given that they voted? What is the probability that someone voted given that they reported being a non-citizen in the survey? What is the implication for studying rare events, such as non-citizen voting using surveys (not designed for that)? Example from Tversky, D.

YEAR &lt;- 2015 We’ll consider a single year in our analysis 2015, which is the last year in the babynames package. The life tables are only provided for the decades from 1900 to 2010. We need to fill in the full life table for all birth years. For years between 1900 and 2010, we will linearly impute the probability of being alive at each age for non-decadal birth years. We’ll use 2010 for all birth-years after 2010. life_table &lt;- babynames::lifetables %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% mutate(px = lx / 1e+05) %&gt;% rename(age = x) %&gt;% select(year, age, sex, p_alive = px) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% complete(sex, year = seq(min(year), YEAR, by = 1), age) %&gt;% rename(birthyear = year) %&gt;% group_by(sex, age) %&gt;% arrange(sex, age, birthyear) %&gt;% mutate(p_alive = zoo::na.approx(p_alive, na.rm = FALSE)) %&gt;% fill(p_alive, .direction = &quot;down&quot;) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% arrange(sex, age, birthyear) For this analysis, we only need the age distribution in 2015. age_distr &lt;- life_table %&gt;% mutate(year = birthyear + age, # convert sex to character to avoid join warning sex = as.character(sex)) %&gt;% filter(year == YEAR) %&gt;% select(-year) glimpse(life_table) #&gt; Observations: 27,840 #&gt; Variables: 4 #&gt; $ sex &lt;fct&gt; M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M, M... #&gt; $ birthyear &lt;dbl&gt; 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908... #&gt; $ age &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0... #&gt; $ p_alive &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1...

Suppose that the number born in each year was equal, the age distribution would be: age_distr %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% mutate(p = p_alive / sum(p_alive)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = p, color = sex)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;P(age)&quot;) + theme(legend.pos = &quot;bottom&quot;) As a proxy for the number born each year we’ll use the proportion of Social Security applicants each year, provided by the babynames::applicants. Since the baby-name information will also come from the Social Security data this is no less restrictive. ggplot(babynames::applicants, aes(x = year, y = n_all / 1e6, color = sex)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;SSA Applicants (mn)&quot;) + theme(legend.pos = &quot;bottom&quot;) Clearly, the number of births is not constant per year.

The Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of classifiers which apply Bayes’ Rule to classify a discrete response \\(y\\) using observed features \\((x_1, \\dots, x_K)\\), with a simplifying assumption of independence. Suppose that \\(y\\) is the class of an observation; i.e., it is a discrete variable taking values \\(j \\in 1, \\dots, J\\). Suppose that \\((x_1, \\dots, x_k)\\) is a vector of \\(K\\) observed features (predictors) for an observation. These can be discrete or continuous. We are interested in the probabilities of each class after having observed its features, which we can reformulate in Bayes’ rule. \\[ p(y | x_1, \\dots, x_k) = \\frac{p(x_1, \\dots, x_k | y) p(y)}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{J} p(x_1, \\dots, x_k | y = j) p(y = j)} \\] The “naive” modifier in “naive Bayes” comes from an additional assumption that distributions of features are independent conditional on the class, \\[ p(x_k | y, x_1, \\dots, x_K) = p(x_k | y) \\] for all \\(k \\in 1, \\dots, K\\). This means that we can write \\[ p(x | y) = p(x_1 | y) p(x_2 | y) \\cdots p(x_K | y) \\] This independence is a strong one, but will make this problem much more tractable. It is much easier to model and estimate the univariate \\(p(x_k | y)\\) probabilities, but much harder to model and estimate a \\(K\\)-variate distribution, \\(p(x_1, \\dots, x_K | y)\\) Using independence, we can rewrite the posterior distribution as, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(y | x_1, \\dots, x_k) &amp;= \\frac{p(y) p(x_1 | y) \\cdots p(x_K | y)}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{J} p(y) p(x_1 | y) \\cdots p(x_K | y)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{p(y) \\prod_{k = 1}^K p(x_k | y)}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{J} p(y) \\prod_{k = 1}^K p(x_k | y)} \\\\ &amp;\\propto p(y) \\prod_{k = 1}^K p(x_k | y) \\end{aligned} \\] To apply Naive Bayes to predict the class of data: Choose the distributional form of \\(p(y)\\) and the \\(k\\) distributions \\(p(x_k | y)\\) Find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of \\(\\hat{p}(y)\\) and \\(\\hat{p}(x_k | y)\\) for all \\(k \\in 1, \\dots, K\\) using training data. Predict the most likely class for new data with features \\(x_1, \\dots, x_K\\), \\[ \\hat{y} = \\arg \\max_y \\hat{p}(y) \\prod_{k = 1}^K \\hat{p}(x_k | y) \\] 4.2 Examples 4.2.1 Federalist Papers The Federalist Papers comprise 85 articles published under the pseudonym “Publius” in New York newspapers between 1787 and 1788. It was written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to persuade the public to ratify the Constitution. John Jay wrote five papers, and Alexander Hamilton wrote 51, and James Madison 14. The authorship of the remaining 15 papers is (was) disputed between Hamilton and Madison. In an early example of empirical Bayesian statistics and computational NLP, F. Mosteller and D. L. Wallace used naive Bayes to classify the disputed articles and conclude that there is strong evidence to suggest that Madison wrote all the disputed articles. Data on the federalist papers is contained in two datasets included in the jrnold.bayes.notes package. The dataset federalist$docs contains metadata on each document, including the author and title. The dataset federalist$wordcounts contains word counts of 70 function words used by Mosteller and Wallace in their analysis, and the count of all other tokens (&quot;OTHER&quot;). data(&quot;federalist&quot;, package = &quot;jrnold.bayes.notes&quot;) The objective is to estimate the author of a document given features of that document. For this example, we will only use the counts of the 70 function words (and other) provided in the data. For a single document, let \\(y\\) be the author of the document. Let \\(w\\) be the total number of words in the document. Let \\(x_1, dots, x_K \\geq 0, \\sum x_k = w\\) be the counts of each word in our vocabulary. These word counts are our features. We need to choose distributional forms of \\(p(x_1, \\dots, x_K | y)\\) and \\(p(y)\\). Since \\(y\\) is a discrete unordered categorical variable, we will use a categorical distribution, \\[ p(y | \\pi) = \\mathrm{Categorical}(\\pi) . \\] There are \\(\\pi_j\\) for \\(j \\in 1, \\dots, J\\) parameters, which represent the probability of category \\(j\\), where \\(\\pi_j | 0\\), and \\(\\sum \\pi = 1\\). For the distribution \\(p(x_1, \\dots, x_K | y)\\), we will use the multinomial distribution, \\[ p(x | y = j, \\theta) = \\mathrm{Multinomial}(x | \\theta^{(j)}) . \\] The parameter \\(\\theta_j\\) is length \\(K\\) vector, such that \\(\\sum_{k = 1}^K \\theta_k^{(j)} = 1\\). The superscript \\((j)\\) indicates that \\(\\theta^{(j)}\\) is specific to a particular class. Thus there are \\(\\text{classes} \\times \\text{features} = J \\times K\\) parameters to estimate for this model. \\[ p(y | x_1, \\dots, x_K) \\propto \\mathrm{Multinomial}(x | \\theta, y) \\mathrm{Categorical}(y | \\pi) . \\] This model is called a multinomial Naive Bayes model. To use a multinomial model to classify new observations we need to estimate \\(\\theta\\) (\\(J \\times K\\) parameters) and \\(\\pi\\) (\\(J\\) parameters). For these, we will use the maximum a posteriori estimator. The MAP estimator for the prior probability of class \\(y\\) is \\[ \\hat{\\pi}_j = \\frac{ \\sum_i I(y_i = j) + 1}{n + J} . \\] This is the number of documents in class \\(j\\) divided by the total number of documents in the training data. Calculate the proportion of documents written by Hamilton and Madison: p_author &lt;- federalist$docs %&gt;% filter(author %in% c(&quot;Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Madison&quot;)) %&gt;% count(author) %&gt;% mutate(pi = (n + 1) / sum(n + 1)) p_author #&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 3 #&gt; author n pi #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Hamilton 51 0.776 #&gt; 2 Madison 14 0.224 The MAP estimator for the conditional probability of \\(p(x | y)\\) is \\[ \\hat{\\theta}_k^{(j)} = \\frac{(\\sum_i I(y_i = j) \\cdot x_k) + 1}{(\\sum_i I(y_i = u)\\cdot w) + K} . \\] The estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{k}^{(j)}\\) is the fraction of times that word \\(k\\) appears among all words in all documents in category \\(j\\). p_words_author &lt;- federalist$wordcounts %&gt;% # keep only Hamilton and Madison filter(author %in% c(&quot;Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Madison&quot;)) %&gt;% # count terms used by each author group_by(author, term) %&gt;% summarise(count = sum(count)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% # calculate p(w | c) for each author group_by(author) %&gt;% mutate(theta = (count + 1) / sum(count + 1)) %&gt;% ungroup() head(p_words_author) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 4 #&gt; author term count theta #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Hamilton a 2496 0.0199 #&gt; 2 Hamilton all 436 0.00347 #&gt; 3 Hamilton also 35 0.000286 #&gt; 4 Hamilton an 636 0.00507 #&gt; 5 Hamilton and 2702 0.0215 #&gt; 6 Hamilton any 365 0.00291 Note that in our MAP estimators of both \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\pi\\), we add one to the observed counts in order to keep the probabilities strictly greater than 0. These can be justified using as conjugate prior distributions for the categorical and multinomial distributions. Now that we’ve estimated \\(\\hat{p}(y | x)\\) and \\(\\hat{p}(y)\\) we can predict the classes for both the papers where the author was observed, and those that it wasn’t observed.

Do any predictions change? Instead of a multinomial model for \\(p(x | y)\\) use independent Poisson distributions for each \\(p(x_k | y, \\lambda)\\). For an MAP estimator of the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution use the following: \\[ \\hat{\\lambda}^{(j)}_k = \\frac{\\sum_i I(y_i = j) x_k + 1}{\\sum_i I(y_i = j) w_i + K} \\] So, \\[ p(x_k | y) = \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda_k) + \\mathrm{Poisson}(w) . \\] Instead of a multinomial model for \\(p(x | y)\\) use independent binomial distributions for each \\(p(x_k | y, \\lambda)\\), \\[ p(x_1, \\dots, x_k| y) = \\prod_{k = 1}^K \\textrm{Binomial}(x_k | w, \\theta_k) \\] Take the word count of each document as given. A MAP estimator of the frequency parameter of the Binomial distribution is \\[ \\hat{\\theta}^{(j)}_k = \\frac{\\sum_i I(y_i = j) x_k + 1}{\\sum_i I(y_i = j) w_i + K} \\] Instead of a multinomial model for \\(p(x | y)\\) use independent Poisson distributions for each \\(p(x_k | y)\\), \\[ p(x_k | w, \\theta) = \\mathrm{Poisson}(w * \\lambda^{-1}) \\] The parameter \\(\\theta\\) is the rate at which the word \\(k\\) is used in text. A MAP estimator for \\(\\theta_k^{(j)}\\) is, \\[ \\hat{\\theta}^{(j)}_k = \\frac{\\sum_i I(y_i = j) x_k + 1}{\\sum_i I(y_i = j) w_i + K} \\] This is the same equation as the Binomial distribution MAP estimator for \\(\\theta\\), and have the same interpretation (frequency of appearance of a term). However, the likelihoods are slightly different. Use cross-validation to evaluate the Naive Bayes models that use multinomial, Poisson, and binomial likelihoods using cross-validation. There are several reasonable ways to proceed with cross validation. Choose a reasonable one associated with the prediction task. Classify the documents in the [spam](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/kernlab/versions/0.9-25/topics/spam) dataset included in the kernlab R package into “spam” and “not spam” using a Naive Bayes model. Choose the appropriate distributions for the likelihoods of the features. Estimate this model “manually”, without using an existing implementation of Naive Bayes. 4.3 Details 4.3.1 Generative vs. Discriminative Models Naive Bayes is a generative model. Generative models are distinguished from discriminative models. A generative model estimates the join-distribution \\(p(x, y)\\), and is so-called because it generate new data for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). A discriminative model only estimates the conditional distribution \\(p(y | x)\\); it cannot generate new \\(x\\) values, but can only predict \\(y\\) given \\(x\\). Naive Bayes is a generative model. The distributions of \\(p(x | y)\\) and \\(p(y)\\) are specified, and \\[ p(x, y) = p(x | y) p(y) . \\] Regression models only estimate \\(p(y | x)\\) are discriminative models. If we estimate the parameters of a regression model, we can cannot estimate the distribution of new \\(x\\). Note that a discriminative model can be used to estimate the conditional distribution \\(p(y | x)\\) since \\[ \\begin{aligned} p(y | x) = \\frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)} = \\frac{p(x | y) p(y)}{p(x)} . \\end{aligned} \\] 4.3.2 Estimation With Naive Bayes we want to classify observations (\\(\\tilde{y}\\)) given the features (\\(\\tilde{x}\\)) of those new observations, and training data (\\(y\\), \\(x\\)). Naive Bayes models define \\(p(x | y)\\) and \\(p(y)\\). Let \\(p(x | y, \\theta)\\) be the conditional distribution of a feature given the class \\(y\\). Let \\(p(y | \\pi)\\) is the prior distribution of the classes \\(y\\). By the definition of conditional distributions, \\[ p(x, y | \\theta, \\pi) = p(x | y, \\theta) p(y | \\pi) . \\] Note: we also make the assumption that \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\pi\\) are independent. The posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\pi\\) is \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\theta, \\pi | y, x) &amp;= \\frac{p(y, x | \\theta, \\pi) p(\\theta, \\pi)}{p(y, x)} &amp; \\text{Bayes&#39; Theorem} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{p(x | y, \\theta) p(y | \\pi) p(\\theta) p(\\pi)}{p(y, x)} &amp; \\text{conditional distribution}\\\\ &amp;\\propto p(x | y, \\theta) p(y | \\pi) p(\\theta) p(\\pi) \\end{aligned} \\] The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of \\((\\theta, \\pi)\\) is \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\hat{\\theta}, \\hat{\\pi} = \\arg \\max_{\\theta, \\pi} p( y | x, \\theta, \\pi) &amp;= \\arg \\max_{\\theta, \\pi} p( x | y, \\theta) p(y | \\pi ) p(\\theta) p(\\pi) \\end{aligned} \\] Since \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\pi\\) are conditionally independent, we can maximize the parameters separately, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\hat{\\theta} &amp;= \\arg \\max_{\\theta} p( x | y, \\theta) p(\\theta) \\\\ \\hat{\\pi} &amp;= \\arg \\max_{\\pi} p(y | \\pi ) p(\\pi) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] For many distributions, the MAP estimators of their parameters has a closed form, and thus easy to estimate. That we factor \\(p(x | y, \\theta)\\) into conditionally independent distributions \\(p(x_1 | y, \\theta_1)\\), \\(p(x_2 | y, \\theta_2)\\), …, allows us to choose these distributions to allow for particularly easy MAP estimators. 4.3.3 Prediction Suppose that we would like to classify new observations \\(\\tilde{y}\\) after observing features of those observations, \\(\\tilde{x}\\). We would use the same likelihood function as we estimation, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\tilde{y} | \\tilde{x}, \\theta, \\pi) &amp;= \\frac{p(\\tilde{x} | \\tilde{y}, \\theta) p(\\tilde{y} | \\pi) }{p(\\tilde{x} | \\theta, \\pi)} \\\\ &amp;\\propto p(\\tilde{x} | \\tilde{y}, \\theta) p(\\tilde{y} | \\pi) \\end{aligned} \\] However, the values of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\pi\\) are unknown. Generally, in Bayesian inference we would calculate the posterior predictive distribution by using the posterior distribution of \\(p(\\theta, \\pi | x, y)\\). \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\tilde{y} | \\tilde{x}, x, y) &amp;= \\int_{\\pi}\\int_{\\theta} p(\\tilde{y} | \\tilde{x}, \\theta, \\pi) p(\\theta, \\pi | y, x)\\, d\\theta \\,d\\pi \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{\\pi}\\int_{\\theta} \\frac{p(\\tilde{x} | \\tilde{y}, \\theta) p(\\tilde{y} | \\pi)}{p(\\tilde{x} | \\pi)} p(\\theta, \\pi | y, x)\\, d\\theta \\,d\\pi &amp; \\text{Bayes&#39; Theorem} \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{\\pi}\\int_{\\theta} \\frac{p(\\tilde{x} | \\tilde{y}, \\theta) p(\\tilde{y} | \\pi)}{p(\\tilde{x} | \\theta, \\pi)} p(\\theta, \\pi | y, x)\\, d\\theta \\,d\\pi \\end{aligned} \\] However, in this case we will ignore the uncertainty inherent in estimating \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\pi\\), and simply plug in the MAP estimators, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\tilde{y} | \\tilde{x}, x, y) &amp;= p(\\tilde{y} | \\tilde{x}, \\hat{\\theta}, \\hat{\\pi}) \\\\ &amp;=\\frac{p(\\tilde{x} | \\tilde{y}, \\hat{\\theta}) p(\\tilde{y} | \\hat{\\pi})}{p(\\tilde{x} | \\hat{\\pi}, \\hat{\\theta})} \\\\ &amp;\\propto p(\\tilde{x} | \\tilde{y}, \\hat{\\theta}) p(\\tilde{y} | \\hat{\\pi}) \\end{aligned} \\] Commonly we would like to estimate the most likely class. The most likely class of an observation given its features, \\(\\tilde{x}\\), and training data \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is, \\[ \\hat{y} = \\arg \\max_{\\tilde{y}} p(\\tilde{y} | \\tilde{x}, x, y) = \\arg \\max_{\\tilde{y}} p(\\tilde{x} | \\tilde{y}, \\hat{\\theta}) p(\\tilde{y} | \\hat{\\pi}). \\] 4.4 References Scikit-Learn, Naive Bayes Harry Zhang (2004) The Optimality of Naive Bayes.

If \\(K \\in \\n\\), \\(N \\in \\N\\), and \\(\\theta \\in K-\\text{simplex}\\), then for \\(y \\in \\N^{K}\\) such that \\(\\sum_{k = 1}^K y_k = N\\), \\[ \\dmultinom(y | \\theta) = \\binom{N}{y_1, \\dots, y_K} \\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \\theta_k^{y_k}, \\] where the multinomial coefficient is defined as, \\[ \\binom{N}{y_1, \\dots, y_K} = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{k = 1}^K y_k!} \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\theta | \\alpha) &amp;= \\ddirichlet(\\theta | \\alpha) &amp;&amp; \\text{Dirichlet prior} \\\\ p(y | \\theta) &amp;= \\dmultinom(y | n, \\theta) &amp;&amp; \\text{Multinomial likelihood} \\\\ p(\\theta | y, \\alpha) &amp;= \\ddirichlet(\\theta | \\alpha + y) &amp;&amp; \\text{Dirichlet posterior} \\end{aligned} \\] 5.2.3 Poisson-Gamma Let \\(\\lambda\\) be the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution. If \\(\\lambda \\in \\R^+\\) (rate parameter), then for \\(n \\in \\N\\), \\[ \\dpois(n|\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{n!} \\lambda^n \\exp(-\\lambda) \\] If \\(\\alpha \\in \\R^{+}\\) (shape parameter), \\(\\beta \\in \\R^{+}\\) (inverse scale parameter), then for \\(y \\in \\R^{+}\\), \\[ \\dgamma(y | \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} y^{\\alpha - 1} \\exp(- \\beta y) \\] Then, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\lambda) &amp;= \\dgamma(\\lambda | \\alpha, \\beta) \\\\ p(n | \\lambda) &amp;= \\dpois(n | \\lambda) \\\\ p(\\lambda | n, \\alpha, \\beta) &amp;= \\dgamma(\\lambda | \\alpha + n, \\beta + 1) \\end{aligned} \\] 5.2.4 Normal with known variance \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\mu | \\mu_0, \\sigma_0) &amp;= \\dnorm(\\mu | \\mu, \\sigma_0^2) &amp;&amp; \\text{Normal prior} \\\\ p(y | \\mu) &amp;= \\dnorm(y | \\mu, \\sigma^2) &amp;&amp; \\text{Normal likelihood} \\\\ p(\\mu | y, \\mu, \\sigma^2, \\mu_0, \\sigma_0^2) &amp;= \\dbeta(\\mu | \\tilde{\\mu}, \\tilde{\\sigma}^2) &amp;&amp; \\text{Normal posterior} \\\\ \\tilde{\\mu} &amp;= \\tilde{\\sigma}^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\sigma_0^2} + \\frac{y}{\\sigma^2} \\right) \\\\ \\tilde{\\sigma}^2 &amp;= \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2} +\\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\right)^{-1} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] 5.2.5 Exponential Family Likelihood functions in the exponential family have conjugate priors, often also in the exponential family.5 5.3 Improper Priors If prior distributions are given an improper uniform prior, \\(p(\\theta) \\propto 1\\), then the posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood, \\[ p(\\theta | y) \\propto p(y | \\theta) p(\\theta) \\propto p(y | \\theta) \\] 5.4 Cromwell’s Rule The use of priors should placing a probability of 0 or 1 on events be avoided except where those events are excluded by logical impossibility. If a prior places probabilities of 0 or 1 on an event, then no amount of data can update that prior. The name, Cromwell’s Rule, comes from a quote of Oliver Cromwell, I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken. Lindley (1991) describes it as Leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese; it can be as small as 1 in a million, but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with samples of the said cheese will leave you unmoved. If \\(p(\\theta = x) = 0\\), then for a value of \\(x\\), then the posterior distribution is always zero. \\[ p(\\theta = x | y) \\propto p(y | \\theta = x) p(\\theta = x) = 0 \\] 5.5 Asymptotics As the sample size increases, the Bayesian distribution converges to a normal distribution centered on the true value of the parameter. Suppose data \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n \\sim\\) are an iid sample from the distribution \\(f(y)\\). Suppose that the data are modeled with a parametric family \\(p(y | \\theta)\\) and a prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\). If the data distribution is included in the parametric family, meaning that there exists a \\(\\theta_0\\) such that \\(p(y | \\theta_0) = f(y)\\), then the posterior distribution is consistent in that it converges to the true parameter value \\(\\theta_0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). Otherwise, the posterior convergences to the distribution \\(p(y | \\theta)\\) closes to the true distribution. As \\(n \\to infty\\), the likelihood dominates the posterior distribution. There are cases in which the normal approximation is incorrect. parameters are non-identified the number of parameters increases with sample size aliasing or non-identified parameters due to label switching unbounded likelihoods. This can happen if variance parameters go to zero. improper posterior distributions prior distributions that exclude the point of convergence. See Cromwell’s Rule. convergence to the edge of the parameter space tails of the distribution can be inaccurate even if the normal approximation converges to the correct value; e.g. the normal approximation will still place a non-zero density on negative values of a non-negative parameter. 5.6 Proper and Improper Priors A prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\) is an improper when it is not a probability distribution, meaning \\[ \\int p(\\theta) \\,d\\theta = \\infty . \\] Perhaps the most common improper distribution is an unbounded uniform distribution, \\[ p(\\theta) \\propto 1 \\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; \\theta &lt; \\infty\\). Improper priors can be used, because in some cases, the posterior distribution can still be proper even if the prior is not. Prior Posterior Improper ? Proper Proper One common case of this is a linear regression model with improper priors. \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X) = \\begin{cases} y &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(X \\beta, \\sigma^{2} I) \\end{cases} \\] If the number of observations (rows of \\(X\\)) is less than the number of independent columns in \\(X\\) (variables plus the constant), then the MLE of \\(\\beta\\) is undefined, and also the posterior distribution is improper. But if alter that model to include a proper prior, \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X) = \\begin{cases} y &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(X \\beta, \\sigma^{2} I) \\\\ \\beta &amp; \\sim \\dnorm(\\mu_\\beta, \\Sigma_\\beta) \\\\ \\gamma &amp;\\sim p(\\gamma) \\end{cases} \\] then we can estimate \\(p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X)\\) even if the number of observations is less than the number of variables. Consider the case if we observe no data; then the posterior distribution is equal to the prior, and since the prior is a proper distribution, so is the posterior. However, because a proper posterior allows for estimating a posterior, does imply that the posterior distribution is any “good”. But that is the role of the evaluation step in Bayesian analysis. In the cases where an improper prior would lead to an improper posterior, the choice of the prior is important because the prior will dominate the shape of the posterior distribution. One way of thinking about many “identification” assumptions in MLE models is that they can loosely be considered “priors”. What is called the likelihood and what is called the the prior is not well-defined, and often the choice of of likelihood functions is both subjective and the most important part of the analysis. Regarding improper priors, also see the asymptotic results that the posterior distribution increasingly depends on the likelihood as sample size increases. Stan: If no prior distributions is specified for a parameter, it is given an improper prior distribution on \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\) after transforming the parameter to its constrained scale. 5.7 Hyperpriors and Hyperparameters A hyperparameter is a parameter in a prior. A hyperprior is a term for a prior on Consider the case of a binomial likelihood with a beta prior on the proportion parameter \\(\\theta\\). The observed value of \\(n\\) and the \\(N\\) \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(n | \\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dBinom(N, \\theta) &amp;&amp; \\text{likelihood for } n \\\\ p(\\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dbeta(a, b) &amp;&amp; \\text{prior on } \\theta \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] This is a model of the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) given the data, where the data consists of the \\(n\\) successes, the total number of trails \\(N\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the assumed shape parameters of the beta prior on \\(\\theta\\). Thus our posterior distribution is, \\[ p(\\theta | n, N, a, b) . \\] However, suppose we decided that since we did not have a good reason to choose any particular values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for the prior distribution, we would treat the shape parameters of the beta distribution as parameters and assign them their own prior distributions, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(n | \\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dBinom(N, \\theta) &amp;&amp; \\text{likelihood for } n \\\\ p(\\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dbeta(\\alpha, \\beta) &amp;&amp; \\text{prior on } \\theta \\\\ p(\\alpha) &amp;\\sim \\dexp(a^*) &amp;&amp; \\text{hyperprior} \\\\ p(\\beta) &amp;\\sim \\dexp(b^*) &amp;&amp; \\text{hyperprior} \\end{aligned} \\] Now the parameters of the model are \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\beta\\), and the data are \\(n\\), \\(N\\), \\(a^{*}\\), and \\(b^{*}\\). Since one parameter in the model (\\(\\theta\\)) is a function of other parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), we call \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) hyperparameters. 5.8 References Stan Wiki and the rstanarm vignette includes comprehensive advice for prior choice recommendations.

There may be multiple intervals that satisfy the definition of a credible interval. The most common are the equal-tailed interval: \\((F^{-1}(p / 2), F^{-1}((1 - p) / 2))\\) where \\(F^{-1}\\) is the quantile function of \\(\\theta\\). The 95% credible interval would use the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles. highest posterior density interval: The shortest credible interval.

You know, a lotta ins, a lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous.” — The Dude (The Big Lebowski) 7.1 How to calculate a posterior? Bayesian inference requires calculating the posterior distribution, \\[ p(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(y | \\theta) p(\\theta)}{\\int_{\\theta&#39; \\in \\Theta} p(y | \\theta&#39;) p(\\theta&#39;)\\, d\\theta&#39; } . \\] However, calculating this quantity is difficult. The denominator (marginal likelihood) is an integral. Additionally, and function of the distribution, e.g. the mean is \\(\\int \\theta p(\\theta | y) \\,d\\theta\\) also requires calculating an integral. In general there are several strategies for this. Symbolic/Analytic: in a few cases, the posterior distribution can be derived symbolically and has a closed-form solution that corresponds distribution that can be sampled from. Conjugate priors are the most common case of this. Functional: find a function that approximates the true posterior. e.g. maximum a posteriori, Laplace/quadratic approximation. Grid/Quadrature. approximate the posterior with a discrete distribution evaluated at a fixed set of points. Sampling. draw a sample from the posterior. Additionally, methods an incorporate and combine various parts of these approaches. 7.2 Example: Globe-tossing model Suppose that we want to estimate the proportion of the Earth’s surface that is water. Suppose that you don’t have any idea what proportion of the Earth’s surface (\\(\\theta\\)) is covered in water, so you think any proportion is equally likely: \\[ \\theta \\sim \\dbeta(1, 1) = \\dunif(0, 1) \\] Alas, the internet is down so you cannot look it up on Wikipedia. Luckily, you do have a globe. Since it would be hard to directly calculate the area on the globe, you estimate the proportion that is water by repeatedly choosing a random point on the globe by spinning it, and marking whether that point is water (&quot;W&quot;) or land (&quot;L&quot;). After 10 spins you have the following sequence of water and land. smpls &lt;- c(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;W&quot;) Given that data, what is your estimate about the proportion of the earth’s surface that is water? y &lt;- sum(smpls == &quot;W&quot;) n &lt;- length(smpls) To summarize, this model is \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y &amp;\\sim dbinom(n, \\theta) \\\\ \\theta &amp;\\sim beta(1, 1) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Suppose we use \\[ \\theta \\sim beta(1, 1) \\] We will calculate this posterior distribution in multiple ways. For now, save the parameters of this model in some object for later reuse. The prior on \\(\\theta\\) is, prior &lt;- list(a = 1, b = 1) Since the beta is a conjugate distribution of the binomial likelihood, we can analytically calculate the posterior distribution. posterior &lt;- list(a = prior$a + y, b = prior$b + n - y) The posterior distribution is \\[ p(\\theta | y) = \\dbeta(3, 9) \\] 7.3 Quadrature 7.3.1 Grid approximation tl;dr: Approximate the posterior distribution by taking a grid of points in \\(\\theta\\) and calculating \\(p(\\theta|y)\\).

However, unlike (most?) other point estimates it does not require first computing the posterior distribution. However, we can consider it a functional approximation of the posterior distribution, in which the approximating distribution is a point mass at \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). Notes: often the maximum of the posterior is much easier to calculate than the entire posterior distribution when the prior is improper, \\(p(\\theta | y) \\propto p(y | theta)\\) and the MAP and maximum likelihood (MLE) estimators produce the same point estimate. 7.4.2 Laplace Approximation tl;dr: approximate the posterior distribution with a normal distribution centered at the maximum. The Laplace or quadratic approximation to the posterior distribution uses a normal approximation to the posterior distribution. Find maximum of \\(p(\\theta | y)\\). Take the Taylor expansion around the maximum \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\theta | y) &amp; \\approx p(\\widehat{\\theta}) + (\\theta - \\widehat{\\theta}) \\left[ \\frac{d}{d \\theta} p(\\theta | y) \\right]_{\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}} + \\frac{1}{2} (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^2 \\left[\\frac{d^2 }{d \\theta^2} p(\\theta| y) \\right]_{\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}} \\\\ &amp;= p(\\widehat{\\theta}) + \\frac{1}{2} (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^2 \\left[\\frac{d^2 }{d \\theta^2} p(\\theta| y) \\right]_{\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] where the second term is zero since \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the maximum of \\(p(\\theta | y)\\), \\(d / d\\theta p(\\theta | y) = 0\\). The first term \\(p(\\theta)\\) is a constant. The second term is proportional to the logarithm of a normal density, \\[ p(\\theta | y) \\approx dnorm\\left(\\hat{\\theta},\\left[ - \\frac{d^2}{d \\theta^2} \\log p(\\theta | y) \\middle|_{\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}} \\right] \\right) \\] Extensions of this approach include: Fitting a mixture of normal densities.

The idea is the same, although the numerical derivatives are slower than symbolic derivatives. Use the R function optimize to calculate the maximum of the posterior. We will need to use the option hessian = TRUE in order to calculate the second derivatives needed for the variance parameter of the normal distribution. Write a function that takes a single parameter par and returns the log posterior value. calc_posterior &lt;- function(par) { lprior &lt;- dbeta(par, prior$a, prior$b, log = TRUE) lpost &lt;- dbinom(y, size = n, prob = par, log = TRUE) - (lprior + lpost) } Find \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) and the second derivative using optim: ret &lt;- optim(0.5, fn = calc_posterior, hessian = TRUE, method = &quot;Brent&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 1) The Hessian is a matrix of the second partial derivatives, which is what we need. theta_max &lt;- ret$par theta_var &lt;- 1 / drop(ret$hessian) Let’s plot the value of the Laplace approximation and the true posterior distribution. tibble( theta = ppoints(100), approx = dnorm(theta, theta_max, sqrt(theta_var)), actual = dbeta(theta, shape1 = posterior$a, shape2 = posterior$b) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = theta)) + geom_line(aes(y = approx)) + geom_line(aes(y = actual), colour = &quot;red&quot;) 7.4.3 Variational Inference tl;dr: approximate the posterior distribution with a simple(r) distribution that is close to the posterior distribution. TODO See Grimmer (2011), Ranganath, Gerrish, and Blei (2014), Kucukelbir et al. (2015), and Blei, Kucukelbir, and McAuliffe (2017). 7.5 Sampling Methods 7.5.1 Numerical Integration Numerical integration calculates a expectation of a function using samples \\(\\theta^1, \\dots, \\theta^S\\) from a distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\), \\[ \\E(h(\\theta) | y) = \\int h(\\theta) p(\\theta | y) d\\theta \\approx \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s = 1}^S h(\\theta^s) . \\] The estimation error improves with the number of (independent) samples. Deterministic numerical integration is based on evaluating \\(h(\\theta) p(\\theta | y)\\) at a set of points \\(\\theta^1, \\dots, \\theta^S\\). \\[ \\E(h(\\theta) | y) = \\int h(\\theta) p(\\theta | y) \\approx \\frac{1}{S} w_s h(\\theta^s) p(\\theta^s | y) , \\] with weights \\(w_s\\) for the volume of each point. The accuracy of this method can improve with smarter choices of the grid and also better interpolation between points. The simplest method is a grid with equal weights, but more sophisticated quadrature methods also exist. 7.5.2 Inverse transform sampling A common method of random sampling is inverse-transformation sampling. Suppose we want to sample from random variable \\(X\\) which has a distribution with a CDF of \\(P(X)\\). We can draw a sample as follows, Draw \\(u\\) from \\(unif(0, 1)\\) Let \\(x = P^{-1}(u)\\), where \\(P^{-1}(X)\\) is the inverse of the CDF (quantile) function for \\(X\\). p &lt;- runif(100) post_inverse &lt;- qbeta(p, shape1 = posterior$a, shape2 = posterior$b) ggplot(tibble(x = post_inverse), aes(x = x)) + geom_density() This generally only works on a univariate distribution We would have to CDF of the posterior distribution analytically, but in hard problems that is something we don’t know. 7.5.3 Direct approximation Compute the target density at the set of of evenly spaced values \\(\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_S\\) that cover (most of) the parameter space for \\(\\theta\\). Approximate \\(p(\\theta | y)\\) by the density at these values with \\[ p(\\theta | y) \\approx \\left\\{ \\frac{p(\\theta_s| y)}{ \\sum_{j = 1}^S p(\\theta_{j} | y)} \\right\\}_{s = 1}^S \\] This will also work with an un-normalized density function. To draw a random sample from this, sample from the discrete approximation with weights proportional to the \\(p(\\theta_s | y)\\). 7.5.3.1 Example In the water example, there is no reason to do this. However, there could be cases where it is possible to calculate the theta_grid &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out = 512) w &lt;- (dbeta(theta_grid, prior$a, prior$b) * dbinom(y, size = n, prob = theta_grid)) theta_direct &lt;- sample(theta_grid, size = 512, replace = TRUE, prob = w) mean(theta_direct) #&gt; [1] 0.254 7.5.4 Rejection sampling tl;dr: Sample from a proposal density and reject with a probability proportional to the ratio of the target density to the proposal density. Works best if the proposal density is close to the target density. Rejection sampling consists of the following: Sample from a proposal density, e.g. the prior \\(p(\\theta)\\) Accept with probability \\(p(\\theta | y) / p(\\theta)\\) Suppose there is a positive function \\(g(\\theta)\\) for all \\(\\theta\\) for which \\(p(\\theta | y) &gt; 0\\), Draw from a probability density proportional to \\(g\\) Importance ratio \\(p(\\theta | y) / g(\\theta)\\) must have a known bound, which means that there exists a constant \\(M\\) such that \\(p(\\theta | y) / g(\\theta) \\leq M\\) for all \\(\\theta\\). The algorithm proceeds as follows Sample \\(\\theta\\) at random from the probability proportional to \\(g(\\theta)\\) With probability \\(p(\\theta | y) / M g(\\theta)\\) accept \\(\\theta\\) as a draw from \\(p\\). If rejected, return to 1. Need to choose \\(M\\) so that the probability in step 2 is not greater than 1. This can be \\(M = \\max p(\\theta | y)\\). But in general, the efficiency of the algorithm depends on \\(M\\), but it may be hard to find a good value. Since the probability of success is \\(1 / M\\), the expected number of draws from proposal density to get a single draw from the The ideal case is that the approximate density \\(g(\\theta)\\) is roughly proportional to \\(p(\\theta | y)\\). univariate distributions truncated distributions, e.g. normal truncated distribution 7.5.5 Importance Sampling tl;dr: Draw a sample from a target distribution from an approximate distribution weight those samples by the ratio of target distribution to the approximate distribution. Works best if the proposal density is close to the target density, or at least wider than the target density. Suppose that we want to know \\(\\E(h(\\theta) | y)\\) but cannot directly sample from \\(p(\\theta | y)\\). However, we can sample from a distribution \\(g(\\theta)\\). Then, \\[ \\E(h(\\theta | y)) = \\frac{\\int h(\\theta) q(\\theta | y) d\\theta}{\\int q(\\theta | y) d\\theta} = \\frac{\\int \\left[h(\\theta) q(\\theta | y) / g(\\theta) \\right] g(\\theta) d\\theta}{\\int \\left[ q(\\theta | y) / g(\\theta) \\right] g(\\theta) d\\theta} \\] This can be estimated using \\(S\\) draws \\(\\theta^1, \\dots, \\theta^S\\) from \\(g(\\theta)\\), \\[ \\frac{\\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s = 1}^s h(\\theta^s) w(\\theta^s)}{\\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s = 1}^S w(\\theta^s)} , \\] where \\[ w(\\theta^s) = \\frac{q(\\theta^s | y)}{g(\\theta^s)} \\] are called the importance ratios or importance weights. use the same set of random draws for the numerator and denominator to reduce sampling error. worst case: importance ratio are small with high probability, but with a low probability are very high. This occurs when the \\(q\\) has wide tails relative to \\(g\\). Can use a \\(t_4\\) distribution as a proposal distribution for a normal distribution, but not a normal distribution for a proposal distribution of a \\(t_4\\) distribution. The values of the importance weights can be used to discover problems with the method. If any ratios are too large, estimates will be poor. If the variance of the weights is finite, the effective sample size is \\[ S_{eff} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{s = 1}^S (\\tilde{w}(\\theta^s))^2} . \\] where \\(\\tilde{w}\\) are the normalized weights, \\[ \\tilde{w}(\\theta^s) = \\frac{w(\\theta^S)}{\\sum_{s&#39; = 1}^S w(\\theta^{s&#39;})}. \\] The loo package uses a method to smooth these importance weights as well as diagnostics for overly large sample weights (Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry 2015, 2017). Importance resampling (or sampling-importance resampling) obtains independent samples with equal weights. Draw \\(S\\) draws \\(\\theta^1, \\dots, \\theta^S\\) from the approximate distribution \\(g\\). Then to draw a sample of size \\(k &lt; S\\), sample without replacement where sampling \\(\\theta^s\\) is proportional to its weight, \\[ \\Pr(\\theta^s) \\propto w(\\theta^s) = \\frac{q(\\theta^s | y)}{g(\\theta^s)} . \\] Sampling without replacement helps to prevent a degenerate case where all or most of the \\(k\\) samples are the same \\(\\theta^s\\) due to large importance ratios. If the proposal distribution is the prior, then the weights are proportional to the likelihood, \\[ w(\\theta^S) = \\frac{p(\\theta | y)}{p(\\theta)} = \\frac{p(y | \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(\\theta)} = p(y | \\theta) \\] Other notes Similar to both rejection sampling and the Metropolis algorithm Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is a variant that is particularly useful for updating posterior distributions when the data arrives sequentially—either real time or because it involves time series data (Carvalho et al. 2010). To update a model when a similar posterior is available. E.g. the posterior distribution for leave-one-out cross validation (Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry 2015). The distribution \\(p(\\theta | y_{-i})\\) is likely to be similar to \\(p(\\theta | y)\\), so if we have already calculated \\(p(\\theta | y)\\) we can use the later as the proposal distribution for \\(p(\\theta | y)\\). See A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Sec 10.4), Gelfand and Smith (1990), Lopes, Polson, and Carvalho (2012), and Smith and Gelfand (1992) for more on importance sampling. 7.5.5.1 Example Use the prior as the proposal distribution. S &lt;- 512 theta &lt;- rbeta(S, prior$a, prior$b) w &lt;- dbinom(y, size = n, prob = theta) The mean value of the posterior is sum(theta * w) / sum(w) #&gt; [1] 0.246 The effective sample size of this sample is, w_tilde &lt;- w / sum(w) 1 / sum(w_tilde ^ 2) #&gt; [1] 215 Finally, to draw a new sample from this, we can draw without replacement, S2 &lt;- 256 post_sir1 &lt;- sample(theta, replace = TRUE, prob = w) or with replacement, post_sir2 &lt;- sample(theta, size = S, replace = TRUE, prob = w) depending on our purposes. 7.5.6 MCMC Methods See A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Ch 11–12) for more on MCMC methods. 7.5.6.1 Metropolis-Hastings The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a family of MCMC methods useful for sampling from posterior distributions. Draw a starting value \\(\\theta^0\\) for which \\(p(\\theta^0 | y) &gt; 0\\). This can be specified manually or sampled from a crude approximation. For iterations *t = 1, 2, …$: Sample a proposal value \\(\\theta^{*}\\) from a jumping distribution (proposal distribution) at time \\(t\\), \\(J_t(\\theta^{*} | \\theta^{t - 1})\\). Calculate the ratio of the density of the proposal and target distributions, \\[ r = \\frac{p(\\theta^{*} | y) / J_t(\\theta^* | \\theta^{t - 1})}{p(\\theta^{t - 1} | y) / J_t(\\theta^{t - 1} | \\theta^{*})} . \\] Set \\[ \\theta^t = \\begin{cases} \\theta^* &amp; \\text{with probability } \\min(r, 1) \\theta^{t - 1} &amp; \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} \\] Thus the transition distribution \\(T_t(\\theta^t | \\theta^{t - 1})\\) is a mixture distribution of point mass at \\(\\theta^t = \\theta^{t - 1}\\) jumping distribution $J_t(^t | ^{t - 1}), with the weights adjusting for the acceptance rates. The main requirements for this algorithm are Be able to draw samples from the jumping distribution \\(J_t(\\theta^* | \\theta)\\) Be able to calculate the density ratio \\(r\\), usually meaning that both \\(p(\\theta^* | y)\\) and \\(p(\\theta^{t - 1} | y)\\) must be able to be calculated for all \\(\\theta\\). The jumping distribution can be asymmetric. However, it if is symmetric (Metropolis algorithm), then the ratio acceptance ratio simplifies to, \\[ r = \\frac{p(\\theta^* | y)}{p(\\theta^{t - 1} | y)} . \\] Notes: For this to work the Markov chain this produces must have stationary distribution that (A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, 279). MH is similar is like a stochastic optimization algorithm. Instead of always moving towards the region of higher density, it only stochastically moves towards the region of higher density. It tunes how often it moves towards the region of higher density in order to ensure that it samples from the distribution in proportion to the density. MH is similar to a dynamic form of rejection sampling or importance sampling. However, whereas those methods have a static proposal distribution, the jumping distribution, while fixed in its parameters, of the HM algorithm is re-centered around the last draw, so it can move to areas of higher density. When does MH not work well? Posterior distributions with wide tails. Multimodal distributions 7.5.6.2 Gibbs Sampler The Gibbs sampler has been one of the most common methods used to sample from posterior distributions. The Gibbs sampler is a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings sampler. Suppose that the parameter vector \\(\\theta\\) can be divided into \\(d\\) subvectors. For iterations, \\(t = 1, \\dots\\): For \\(j \\in 1, \\dots, d\\) Draw a value from the conditional distribution of \\(\\theta_j\\) given all the other parameters, \\[ \\theta_{j}^t \\sim p(\\theta_j | \\theta^{t - 1}_{-j}, y), \\] where \\(\\theta^{t - 1}_{-j}\\) has consists of updated parameters for all parameters preceding \\(j\\) and the previous iteration’s values for all succeeding parameters, \\[ \\theta_{-j}^{t - 1} = \\left(\\theta_1^t, \\dots, \\theta_{j - 1}^t, \\theta_{j - 1}^{t - 1}, \\dots, \\theta_d^{t - 1}\\right) . \\] Gibbs sampler is a special case of MH algorithm. It is appealing because the use of full-conditional distributions means that draws are never rejected. The use of full-conditional distributions often results in highly correlated iterations. Many applications adjust the method to reduce these correlations. It can be difficult to derive the full-conditional distributions in many cases. 7.5.6.3 Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) 7.5.6.3.1 Assessing Convergence Iterative simulation methods have two additional issues above and beyond those of simulations (A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, 282): The iterations have not proceeded long enough to find the typical set and are not drawing samples from the target distribution. The samples have within-sequence correlations. Serial correlation is not a fatal problem. How to monitor and assess iterative simulation Design simulations to allow monitoring of convergence by running multiple chains from dispersed starting points. Monitor convergence by comparing within chain variation and between variation using the \\(\\hat{R}\\) statistic. Only when the between and within variations are approximately equal will the multiple chains appear to be sampling from the same distribution. Require a certain level of efficiency in the output in terms of acceptable sample size. If that that efficiency is too costly to obtain, it may require tweaking the model or the algorithm to be more efficient. See A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Ch. 12) for methods to speed up MCMC. 7.5.7 Discarding early iterations Because iterative algorithms may take time to find the typical set of the target distribution, sometimes the early iterations are discarded. In Gibbs sampling, it is common to have a “burn-in” period which is discarded. The algorithm is theoretically still sampling from the posterior distribution, but in the burn-in period it may not have wandered into the typical yet and thus those draws are unrepresentative. In HMC methods, there is a “warmup” period of each chain. In this period the algorithm is not sampling using a method guaranteed to draw a sample from the posterior distribution. Instead it is searching for values of the tuning-parameters of the algorithm. Only after these turning-parameters are set are samples used for analysis. This is similar to the burn-in period of Gibbs sampling in that those iterations are discarded. However, it is serving a fundamentally different role in that the Generally, the issue with MCMC algorithms is not in finding the typical set. In application, they tend to find typical set quickly (FIND CITE – Jackman?). Generally, the larger issue is that the draws are correlated and it may take a long time to explore the posterior distribution. See A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 282). 7.5.8 Monte Carlo Sampling Monte Carlo methods are used to numerically approximate integrals, when the integral function is not tractable but the function being integrated is. In Bayesian stats, the mean of a probability density \\(p(\\theta)\\) is \\[ \\mu = \\int_{\\Theta} \\theta p(\\theta) \\, d \\theta . \\] Except for cases in which the distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\) has a known form (not the case for most applied models) for functional form of the integral isn’t known, but \\(p(\\theta)\\) is The Monte Carlo estimate of \\(\\mu\\) is. Draw \\(N\\) independent samples, \\(\\theta^{(1)}, \\dots, \\theta^{(N)}\\), from \\(p(\\theta)\\). Estimate \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) with \\[ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n = 1}^N \\theta^{(N)} . \\] If \\(p(\\theta)\\) has finite mean and variance, the law of large numbers ensures that the Monte Carlo estimate converges to the true value \\[ \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\hat\\mu \\to \\mu \\] and the estimation error is governed by the CLT, \\[ | \\mu - \\hat{\\mu} | \\propto \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\] Example: The mean of \\(Y = X^2\\) where \\(X \\sim \\dnorm(0, 1)\\). Draw a sample from \\(Y\\), x &lt;- rnorm(1024, 0, 1) ^ 2 The Monte Carlo estimates of the mean is mean(x) #&gt; [1] 1.03 with standard error, sd(x) / sqrt(length(x)) #&gt; [1] 0.0456 "],

Is it adequately approximating the specified posterior distribution: \\(p(\\theta | D)\\). model fit: Does the model adequately represent the data? This chapter covers the former. Also see the bayesplot vignette Visual MCMC diagnostics using the bayesplot package, which though specific to the provides, provides a good overview of these diagnostics. Prerequisites library(&quot;rstan&quot;) library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) 8.1 Reparameterize Models Reduce correlation between parameters (e.g. see mcmc_pairs) Put parameters on the same scale. The samplers work best when all parameters are roughly on the same scale, e.g. \\(\\approx 1\\). Try to avoid situations where parameters are orders of magnitude different, e.g. 1e-5 and 1e+10. Increase the informativeness of priors. If parameters are too uninformative, the posterior distribution may have wide tails that hamper sampling. One way of thinking about it is that the model is only “weakly identified” and requires either more data or more informative priors to estimate. 8.2 Convergence Diagnostics Under certain conditions, MCMC algorithms will draw a sample from the target posterior distribution after it has converged to equilibrium. However, since in practice, any sample is finite, there is no guarantee about whether its converged, or is close enough to the posterior distribution. In general there is no way to prove that the sampler has converged.6 However, there are several statistics that indicate that a sampler has not converged. 8.2.1 Potential Scale Reduction (\\(\\hat{R}\\)) In equilibrium, the distribution of samples from chains should be the same regardless of the initial starting values of the chains (Stan Development Team 2016, Sec 28.2). One way to check this is to compare the distributions of multiple chains—in equilibrium they should all have the same mean. Additionally, the split \\(\\hat{R}\\) tests for convergence by splitting the chain in half, and testing the hypothesis that the means are the same in each half. This tests for non-stationarity within a chain. See Stan Development Team (2016 Sec 28.2) for the equations to calculate these. TODO: Examples of passing and non-passing \\(\\hat{R}\\) chains using fake data generated from known functions with a given autocorrelation. Rule of Thumb: The rule of thumb is that R-hat values for all less than 1.1 source. Note that all parameters must show convergence. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for convergence. 8.2.2 References A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 267) Stan Development Team (2016 Ch 28.) for how Stan calculates Hat, autocorrelations, and ESS. Gelman and Rubin (1992) introduce the R-hat statistic 8.3 Autocorrelation, Effective Sample Size, and MCSE MCMC samples are dependent. This does not effect the validity of inference on the posterior if the samplers has time to explore the posterior distribution, but it does affect the efficiency of the sampler. In other words, highly correlated MCMC samplers requires more samples to produce the same level of Monte Carlo error for an estimate. 8.3.1 Effective Sample Size The effective sample size (ESS) measures the amount by which autocorrelation in samples increases uncertainty (standard errors) relative to an independent sample. Suppose that the \\(\\rho^2_t\\) is the ACF function of a sample of size \\(N\\), the effective sample size, \\(N_eff\\), is \\[ N_{eff} = \\frac{N}{\\sum_{t = -\\infty}^\\infty \\rho_t} = \\frac{N}{1 + 2 \\sum_{t = -\\infty}^\\infty \\rho_t}. \\] TODO show that if \\(\\rho_t = 1\\) for all \\(t\\) then \\(N_eff = 1\\), and if \\(\\rho_t = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) then \\(N_eff = N\\) Computing the effective sample size requires calculating an autocorrelation. A multi-chain estimate of the autocorrelation is found by computing the variogram with the correlations for all lags, \\[ V_t = \\frac{1}{m(n - t)} \\sum_{j = 1}^m \\sum_{i = t + 1}^n (\\psi_{i,j} - \\psi_{i - t,j})^2 \\] The estimate of the autocorrelations \\(\\hat{\\rho}_t\\) is \\[ \\hat{\\rho}_t = 1 - \\frac{V_t}{2 \\widehat{\\mathrm{var}}^+} \\] The estimates of the autocorrelations can be noisy, so \\(\\hat{\\rho}_t\\) are summed from 0, to the last \\(t\\) such that \\(\\rho\\) is positive (\\(T\\)), \\[ \\hat{n}_{eff} = \\frac{mn}{1 + 2 \\sum_{t = 1}^T \\hat{\\rho}_t} \\] See also Stan Development Team (2016 Sec 28.4), Geyer (2011), and A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Sec 11.5). This isn’t the only way to calculate the effective sample size. The coda package function coda uses a different method. The differences are due to how the autocorrelation is calculated. Example: Comparison of the effective sample sizes for data generated with various levels of autocorrelation. The package rstan does not directly expose the function it uses to calculate ESS, so this ess function does so (for a single chain). ess &lt;- function(x) { N &lt;- length(x) V &lt;- map_dbl(seq_len(N - 1), function(t) { mean(diff(x, lag = t) ^ 2, na.rm = TRUE) }) rho &lt;- head_while(1 - V / var(x), ~ . &gt; 0) N / (1 + sum(rho)) } n &lt;- 1024 sims &lt;- map_df(c(0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.99), function(ar) { tibble(ar = ar, y = if (ar == 0) { rnorm(n) } else { as.numeric(arima.sim(list(ar = ar), n)) }, x = seq_along(y), n_eff = ess(y), label = sprintf(&quot;AR = %.2f (n_eff = %.0f)&quot;, ar, n_eff)) } ) ggplot(sims, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ label, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) 8.4 Thinning Since the autocorrelation tends to decrease as the lag increases, thinning samples will reduce the final autocorrelation in the sample while also reducing the total number of samples saved. Due to the autocorrelation, the reduction in the number of effective samples will often be less than number of samples removed in thinning. Both of these will produce 1,000 samples from the posterior, but effective sample size of \\(B\\) will be greater than the effective sample size of \\(A\\), since after thinning g the autocorrelation in \\(B\\) will be lower. A Generating 1,000 samples after convergence and save all of them B Generating 10,000 samples after convergence and save every 10th sample In this case, A produces 10,000 samples, and B produces 1,000. The effective sample size of A will be higher than B. However, due to autocorrelation, the proportional reduction in the effective sample size in B will be less than the thinning: \\(N_{eff}(A) / N_{eff}(B) &lt; 10\\). A Generating 10,000 samples after convergence and save all of them B Generating 10,000 samples after convergence and save every 10th sample Thinning trades off sample size for memory, and due to autocorrelation in samples, loss in effective sample size is less than the loss in sample size. Thinning has become less of an issue as memory has become less of a computational constraint, and samplers have become more efficient. The following example simulates random values from an autocorrelated series, and applies different levels of thinning. Thinning is always decreasing the effective sample size. However, the number of effective samples per sample (n_eff / n) increases until the thinning is large enough that the thinned samples are uncorrelated. thin_ess &lt;- function(thin, x) { if (thin &gt; 1) { # keep only thinned rows x_thinned &lt;- x[(seq_len(length(x)) %% thin) == 1] } else { x_thinned &lt;- x } tibble(thin = thin, n = length(x_thinned), n_eff = ess(x_thinned), `n_eff / n` = n_eff / n) } map_df(c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), thin_ess, x = arima.sim(list(ar = .9), 4096)) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 4 #&gt; thin n n_eff `n_eff / n` #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 4096 1266. 0.309 #&gt; 2 2 2048 1087. 0.531 #&gt; 3 4 1024 791. 0.773 #&gt; 4 8 512 512 1 #&gt; 5 16 256 256 1 #&gt; 6 32 128 128 1 A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 282–83) Stan Development Team (2016, 354–55) 8.4.1 Traceplots Trace plots are a time series of sampler iterations, e.g. as produced by bayesplot. These can, but should not, be used to assess convergence, such visual inspection is ‘notoriously unreliable’ (A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, 285) it cannot scale to many parameters Trace plots may be useful for diagnosing convergence problems after \\(\\hat{R}\\) or or \\(n_eff\\) indicates problems. Some possible issues to check in these plots are multimodality (the traceplot jumps between different distributions) wide posterior tails (the traceplot shows regions where the sampler will reach and have difficulty returning to the main distribution) 8.4.2 Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE) The Monte Carlo standard error is the uncertainty about a statistic in the sample due to sampling error. With a independent sample of size \\(N\\), the MCSE for the sample mean is \\[ MCSE(\\bar{\\theta}) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}} \\] where \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation. However, MCMC are generally not independent, and the MCSE will be higher than that of an independent sample. One way to calculate the MCSE with autocorrelated samples is to use the effective sample size instead of the sample size, \\[ MCSE(\\bar{\\theta}) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N_{eff}}} \\] An MCSE estimator for the mean is \\[ \\mathrm{MCSE}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\frac{\\sd(\\theta)}{\\sqrt{n_{neff}}} \\] An MCSE estimator for any posterior probability, where \\(\\hat{p} = \\Pr(f(\\theta))\\), follows from the standard error of a proportion, but using the effective sample size, \\[ MCSE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\hat{p} (1 - \\hat{p}) / n_{eff}} \\] See Flegal, Haran, and Jones (2008) and the mcmcse for methods to calculate MCMC standard errors for means and quantiles using sub-sampling methods. Flegal, Haran, and Jones (2008) argues for using ESS as a stopping rule and convergence diagnostic for Bayesian inference. The estimation of standard errors for quantiles, as would be used in is more complicated. See the package mcmcse for Monte Carlo standard errors of quantiles (though calculated in a different method than rstan). A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Sec. 10.5) Flegal, Haran, and Jones (2008) Talk by Geyer on MCSE 8.5 HMC-NUT Specific Diagnostics Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), and the No-U-Turn Sampler (HMC-NUTS) in particular, produce several diagnostics that indicate that the sampler is breaking and, thus, not sampling from the posterior distribution. This is unusual, as most Bayesian sampling methods do not give indication of whether they are working well, and all that can be checked are the properties of the samples themselves with methods such \\(\\hat{R}\\). Three specific HMC-NUTS diagnostics are divergent transitions maximum tree-depth Bayesian fraction of missing information The general way to fix these issues is the manually adjust the HMC-NUTS sampler parameters.n Stepsize: Length of the steps to take Tree-depth: Number of steps to take During the warmup period, Stan tunes these values, however these auto-tuned parameters may not always be optimal. The other alternative is to reparameterize the models. 8.5.1 Divergent transitions The details of the HMC are technical and can be found TODO. The gist of the problem is that Stan is using a discrete approximation of a continuous function when integrating. If the step sizes are too large, the discrete approximation does not work. Helpfully, when the approximation is poor it does not fail without any indication but will produce “divergent transitions”. If there are too many divergent transitions, then the sampler is not drawing samples from the entire posterior and inferences will be biased. Reduce the step size. This can be done by increasing the the adapt_delta parameter. This is the target average proposal acceptance probability in the adaptation, which is used to determine the step size during warmup. A higher desired acceptance probability (closer to 1) reduces the the step size. A smaller step size means that it will require more steps to explore the posterior distribution. See Stan Development Team (2016, 380) 8.5.2 Maximum Tree-depth NUTS is an intelligent method to select the number of steps to take in each iteration. However, there is still a maximum number of steps that NUTS will try. If the sampler is often hitting the maximum number of steps, it means that the optimal number of steps to take in each iteration is higher than the maximum. While divergent transitions bias inference, a too-small maximum tree-depth only affects efficiency. The sampler is still exploring the posterior distribution, but the exploration will be slower and the autocorrelation higher (effective sample size lower) than if the maximum tree-depth were set higher. Increase the maximum tree-depth. 8.5.3 Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information This is rather technical. See Betancourt (2016). 8.6 Debugging Bayesian Computing See A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 270), … Pick a reasonable value for the “true” parameter vector \\(\\theta^* \\sim p(\\theta)\\). This should be a random draw from the prior, but if \\(\\theta\\) is uninformative, then any reasonable value of \\(\\theta\\) should work. Draw all other parameters that are conditional on \\(\\theta^*\\). Simulate a large fake dataset \\(y^{fake}\\) from the data distribution \\(p(y | \\theta^*)\\) Calculate the posterior \\(p(\\theta | y^{rep})\\). Compare the posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta | y)\\) to its true value \\(\\theta^*\\). For example there should be a 50% probability that the 50% posterior interval of \\(p(\\theta | y)\\) contains \\(\\theta^*\\). Notes for large number of parameters: calculate the proportion of 50% credible intervals that contain the true value. residual plot: for all scalar parameters \\(\\theta_j\\), calculate the residual \\(\\E[\\theta_j] - \\theta^*\\). The residuals should have mean 0. for models with few parameters, perform many fake data simulations. convergence and posterior predictive tests may also indicate issues with the model. it could be either a problem with the model, or a problem in computation. simplify the model by removing parameters or setting them to fixed values Start with a simple model and build complexity. This is useful both because the simple model may be “good enough” for your purposes, and because adding one part at a time makes it easier to catch and fix bugs. This is also the case in optimization with non-convex objective functions.↩ "],

In theory, a Bayesian model should include all relevant substantive knowledge and subsume all possible theories. In practice, it won’t. We need to check how the model fits data. The question is not whether a model is “true”; it isn’t (Box 1976). The question is whether it is good enough for the purposes of the analysis. The problem is how we can specify “good enough” criteria, and how we can check those criteria. See Gelman, Meng, and Stern (1996), A. Gelman (2007), Gelman (2009), A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Ch. 6), A. Gelman and Shalizi (2012b), Kruschke (2013), A. Gelman and Shalizi (2012a), Gelman (2014) for a more discussion of the motivation and use of posterior predictive checks.b 9.2 Posterior Predictive Checks One method evaluate the fit of a model is to use posterior predictive checks Fit the model to the data to get the posterior distribution of the parameters: \\(p(\\theta | D)\\) Simulate data from the fitted model: \\(p(\\tilde{D} | \\theta, D)\\) Compare the simulated data (or a statistic thereof) to the observed data and a statistic thereof. The comparison between data simulated from the model can be formal or visual. Within a Stan function, this is done in the generated quantities block using a _rng distribution functions. The package bayesplot includes multiple functions for posterior predictive checks; see the help for PPC-overview for a summary of these functions. 9.2.1 Bayesian p-values A posterior predictive p-value is a the tail posterior probability for a statistic generated from the model compared to the statistic observed in the data. Let \\(y = (y_1, \\dots, y_n)\\) be the observed data. Suppose the model has been fit and there is a set of simulation \\(\\theta^(s)\\), \\(s = 1, \\dots, n_sims\\). In replicated dataset, \\(y^{rep(s)\\), has been generated from the predictive distribution of the data, \\(p(y^{(rep)} | \\theta = \\theta^{(s)}\\). Then the ensemble of simulated datasets, \\((y^{rep(s)}, \\dots, y^{rep(nsims)})\\), is a sample from the posterior predictive distribution, \\(p(y^{(rep)} | y)\\) The model can be tested by means of discrepancy statistics, which are some function of the data and parameters, \\(T(y, \\theta)\\). If \\(\\theta\\) was known, then compare discrepancy by \\(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta)\\). The statistical significance is \\(p = \\Pr(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta) &gt; T(y, \\theta) | y, \\theta)\\). If \\(\\theta\\) is unknown, then average over the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\), \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p &amp;= \\Pr(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta) &gt; T(y, \\theta) | y) \\\\ &amp;= \\int Pr(T(y^{(rep)}, \\theta) &gt; T(y, \\theta) | y, \\theta) p(\\theta | y) d\\,\\theta , \\end{aligned} \\] which is easily estimated from the MCMC samples as, \\[ p = \\frac{1}{n_{sims}}\\sum_{s = 1}^{n_{sims}} 1( T(y^{rep(s)}, \\theta(s)) &gt; T(y, \\theta(s))) \\] 9.2.2 Test quantities The definition of a posterior p-value does not specify a particular test-statistic, \\(T\\), to use. The best advice is that \\(T\\) depends on the application. A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 146) Speed of light example uses the 90% interval (61st and 6th order statistics). A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 147) binomial trial example uses the number of switches (0 to 1, or 1 to 0) in order to test independence. A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 148) hierarchical model for adolescent smoking uses. percent of adolescents in the sample who never smoked percentage in the sample who smoked in all waves percentage of “incident smoker”: adolescents who began the study and non-smokers and ended as smokers. 9.2.3 p-values vs. u-values A posterior predictive p-value is different than a classical p-value. Posterior predictive \\(p\\)-value distributed uniform if the model is true. Classical \\(p\\)-value distributed uniform if the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is true. A \\(u\\)-value* is any function of the data that has a \\(U(0, 1)\\) sampling distribution (A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, 151) a \\(u\\)-value can be averaged over \\(\\theta\\), but it is not Bayesian, and is not a probability distribution posterior p-value: probability statement, conditional on model and data, about future observations 9.2.4 Marginal predictive checks Compare statistics for each observation. Conditional Predictive Ordinate (CPO): The CPO (Gelfand 1995) is the leave-one-out cross-validation predictive density: \\[ p(y_i | y_{-i}) = \\int p(y_i | \\theta) p(\\theta | y_{-i}) d\\,\\theta \\] The pointwise predicted LOO probabilities can be calculated using PSIS-LOO or WAIC in the loo package. Predictive Concordance and Predictive Quantiles Gelfand (1995) classifies any \\(y_i\\) that is outside the central 95% predictive posterior of \\(y^{rep}_i\\) is an outlier. Let the predictive quantile (\\(PQ_i\\)) be \\[ PQ_i = p(y_i^{(rep)} &gt; y_i) . \\] Then the predictive concordance be the proportion of \\(y_i\\) that are not outliers. Gelfand (1995) argues that the predictive concordance should match 95%. In other words that the posterior predictive distribution should have the correct coverage. 9.2.5 Outliers Can be identified by the inverse-CPO. larger than 40 are possible outliers, and those higher than 70 are extreme values (Ntzoufras 2009, 376). Congdon (2014) scales CPO by dividing each by its individual max and considers observations with scaled CPO under 0.01 as outliers. 9.2.6 Graphical Posterior Predictive Checks Visualization can surprise you, but it doesn’t scale well. Modeling scales well, but it can’t surprise you. – paraphrase of Hadley Wickham Instead of calculating posterior probabilities, plot simulated data and observed data and visually compare them. See A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013, 154). plot simulated data and real data (A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, 154). This is similar to ideas in Wickham et al. (2010). plot summary statistics or inferences residual plots Bayesian residuals have a distribution \\(r_i^{(s)} = y_i - \\E(y_i \\theta^{s})\\) Bayesian residual graph plots single realization of the residuals, or a summary of their posterior distributions binned plots are best for discrete data (A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, 157) 9.3 References See A. Gelman and Shalizi (2012b), A. Gelman and Shalizi (2012a), Kruschke (2013). "],

Accounting for model choice: Model choice is another avenue for overfitting the data, which is only partly alleviated by including all sources of uncertainty in Bayesian analysis. ALternative model formulations: Often including more complex models is preferrable since it includes that uncertainty. However, computation limits this. Use model checking and sensitivity analysis to choose to expand models. 10.2 Posterior Predictive Criteria Most of these notes summarize the more complete treatment in A. Gelman, Hwang, and Vehtari (2013) and Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry (2015). 10.2.1 Summary and Advice Models can be compared using its expected predictive accuracy on new data. Ways to evaluate predictive accuracy: log posterior predictive density: \\(\\log p_post(\\tilde{y})\\). The log probability of observing new scoring rules or loss functions specific to the problem/research question Several methods to estimate expected log posterior predictive density (elpd) within-sample log-posterior density (biased, too optimistic) information criteria: WAIC, DIC, AIC with correct the bias within-sample log-posterior density with a penalty (number of parameters) cross-validation: estimate it using heldout data What should you use? Use the Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling LOO (Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry 2015) implemented in the loo package: It is computationally efficient as it doesn’t require completely re-fitting the model, unlike actual cross-validation it is fully Bayesian, unlike AIC and DIC it seems to perform better than WAIC it provides indicators for when it is a poor approximation (unlike AIC, DIC, and WAIC) next best approximation would be the WAIC. No reason to use AIC or DIC ever. For observations which the PSIS-LOO has \\(\\hat{k} &gt; 0.7\\) (the estimator has infinite variance) and there aren’t too many, use LOO-CV. If PSIS-LOO has many observations with with \\(k &gt; 0.7\\), then use LOO-CV or k-fold CV If the likelihood doesn’t easily partition into observations or LOO is not an appropriate prediction task, use the appropriate CV method (block k-fold, partitioned k-fold, time-series k-fold, rolling forecasts, etc.) 10.2.2 Expected Log Predictive Density Let \\(f\\) be the true model, \\(y\\) be the observed data, and \\(\\tilde{y}\\) be future data or alternative data not used in fitting the model.

Also see the rstan vignette for similar content. Prerequisites library(&quot;rstan&quot;) library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(&quot;recipes&quot;) For this section we will use the duncan dataset included in the carData package. Duncan’s occupational prestige data is an example dataset used throughout the popular Fox regression text, Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models (Fox 2016). It is originally from Duncan (1961) consists of survey data on the prestige of occupations in the US in 1950, and several predictors: type of occupation, income, and education of that data(&quot;Duncan&quot;, package = &quot;carData&quot;) 11.1 OLS and MLE Linear Regression The first step in running a Stan model is defining the Bayesian statistical model that will be used for inference. We will model prestige of each occupation as a function of its education, occupation, and type. A standard way to do this is with the OLS estimator: \\[ \\begin{multline} y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I(\\mathtt{type} = \\mathtt{&quot;prof&quot;}) + \\beta_2 I(\\mathtt{type} = \\mathtt{&quot;wc&quot;}) \\\\ \\quad + \\beta_3 \\mathtt{income} + \\beta_4 \\mathtt{education} + \\epsilon_i \\end{multline} \\] duncan_lm &lt;- lm(prestige ~ type + income + education, data = Duncan) \\[ y_i = x_i&#39; \\beta + \\epsilon_i \\] OLS finds \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS}\\) by minimizing the squared errors, \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{OLS}} = \\arg \\min_{b} \\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - x_i&#39; b)^2 . \\] OLS is an estimator of the (linear approximation of) the conditional expectation function, \\[ \\mathrm{CEF}(y_i | x_i) = E(y_i, x_i&#39; \\beta) . \\] For valid inference we need to make assumptions about \\(\\epsilon_i\\), namely that they are uncorrelated with \\(X\\), \\(\\Cov(\\epsilon, X) = 0\\), and that they are i.i.d, \\(\\Cov(\\epsilon_i, \\epsilon_j) = 0\\), \\(\\Var(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2\\) for all \\(i\\). However, no specific distributional form is or needs to be assumed for \\(\\epsilon\\) since CLT results show that, asymptotically the sampling distribution of \\(\\beta\\) approaches the normal. Additionally, although \\(\\hat\\sigma^2 = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\epsilon_i / (n - k - 1)\\) is a estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\), standard errors of the standard error of the regression are not directly provided. However, the OLS estimator is also the same as the MLE estimator for \\(\\beta\\) (but not \\(\\sigma\\)): \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(y_1, \\dots, y_n | \\beta, \\sigma, x_1, \\dots, x_n) &amp;= \\prod_{i = 1}^n p(y_i | \\beta, x_i) \\\\ &amp;= \\prod_{i = 1}^n N(y_i | x_i&#39; \\beta) \\\\ &amp;= \\prod_{i = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\left( \\frac{-(y_i - x_i&#39; \\beta)}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) \\end{aligned} \\] so, \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_{MLE}, \\hat{\\sigma}_{MLE} = \\arg\\max_{b,s} \\prod_{i = 1}^n N(y_i | x_i&#39; b, s^2) . \\] And \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{MLE} = \\hat{\\beta}_{OLS}\\). Note that the OLS estimator is equivalent to the MLE estimator of \\(\\beta\\), \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\hat{\\beta}_{MLE} &amp;= \\arg \\max_{b} \\prod_{i = 1}^n N(y_i | x_i&#39; b, \\sigma^2) \\\\ &amp;= \\arg \\max_{b} \\prod_{i = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(y_i - x_i&#39; \\beta)^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\arg \\max_{b} \\log \\left( \\prod_{i = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-(y_i - x_i&#39; \\beta)}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\arg \\max_{b} \\sum_{i = 1}^n - \\log \\sigma - \\frac{1}{2} \\log 2 \\pi + \\frac{-(y_i - x_i&#39; \\beta)^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\arg \\max_{b} \\sum_{i = 1}^n -(y_i - x_i&#39; \\beta)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\arg \\min_{b} \\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - x_i&#39; \\beta)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\hat{\\beta}_{OLS} \\end{aligned} \\] However, the estimator of \\(\\sigma^2_{MLE} \\neq \\sigma^2_{OLS}\\). 11.1.1 Bayesian Model with Improper priors In Bayesian inference, our target is the posterior distribution of the parameters, \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\): \\(p(\\beta, \\sigma^2 | y, X)\\). \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X) \\propto p(y | \\beta, \\sigma) p(\\beta, \\sigma) \\] For a Bayesian linear regression model, we’ll need to specify distributions for \\(p(y | \\beta, \\sigma)\\) and \\(p(\\beta, \\sigma)\\). Likelihood: \\(p(y_i | x_i, \\beta, \\sigma)\\) suppose that the observations are distributed independent normal: \\[ y_i \\sim \\dnorm(\\beta&#39;x_i, \\sigma^2) \\] Priors: The model needs to specify a prior distribution for the parameters \\((\\beta, \\sigma)\\). Rather than specify a single distribution for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), it will be easier to specify independent (separate) distributions for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). We will use what are called an improper uniform priors. An improper prior is, \\[ p(\\theta) \\propto C \\] where \\(C\\) is some constants. This function puts an equal density on all values of the support of \\(\\theta\\). This function is not a proper probability density function since \\(\\int_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} C d \\theta = \\infty\\). However, for some Bayesian models, the prior does not need to be a proper probability function for the posterior to be a probability function. In this example we will put improper prior distributions on \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma) = C \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned} p(\\beta, \\sigma | x, y) &amp;\\propto p(y| \\beta, \\sigma, x) p(\\beta, \\sigma, x) \\\\ &amp;= \\prod_{i = 1}^n N(y_i | x_i&#39; \\beta, \\sigma^2) \\cdot C \\\\ &amp;\\propto \\prod_{i = 1}^n N(y_i | x_i&#39; \\beta, \\sigma^2) \\end{aligned} \\] Note that under the improper priors, the posterior is proportional to the likelihood, \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | x, y) \\propto p(y | x, \\beta, \\sigma) \\] Thus the MAP (maximum a posterior) estimator is the same as the MLE, \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_{MAP}, \\hat{\\sigma}_{MAP} = \\arg\\max_{\\beta, \\sigma} p(\\beta, \\sigma | x, y) = \\arg \\max_{\\beta, \\sigma} p(y | x, \\beta, \\sigma) = \\hat{\\beta}_{MLE}, \\hat{\\sigma}_{MLE} \\] 11.2 Stan Model Let’s write and estimate our model in Stan. Stan models are written in its own domain-specific language that focuses on declaring the statistical model (parameters, variables, distributions) while leaving the details of the sampling algorithm to Stan. A Stan model consists of blocks which contain declarations of variables and/or statements. Each block has a specific purpose in the model. 11.3 Sampling Model with Stan functions { // OPTIONAL: user-defined functions } data { // read in data ... } transformed data { // Create new variables/auxiliary variables from the data } parameters { // Declare parameters that will be estimated } transformed parameters { // Create new variables/auxiliary variables from the parameters } model { // Declare your probability model: priors, hyperpriors &amp; likelihood } generated quantities { // Declare any quantities other than simulated parameters to be generated } The file lm0.stan is a Stan model for the linear regression model previously defined. // lm_normal_1.stan // Linear Model with Normal Errors data { // number of observations int N; // response vector[N] y; // number of columns in the design matrix X int K; // design matrix X // should not include an intercept matrix [N, K] X; // priors on alpha real scale_alpha; vector[K] scale_beta; real loc_sigma; // keep responses int use_y_rep; int use_log_lik; } parameters { // regression coefficient vector real alpha; vector[K] beta; real sigma; } transformed parameters { vector[N] mu; mu = alpha + X * beta; } model { // priors alpha ~ normal(0., scale_alpha); beta ~ normal(0., scale_beta); sigma ~ exponential(loc_sigma); // likelihood y ~ normal(mu, sigma); } generated quantities { // simulate data from the posterior vector[N * use_y_rep] y_rep; // log-likelihood posterior vector[N * use_log_lik] log_lik; for (i in 1:num_elements(y_rep)) { y_rep[i] = normal_rng(mu[i], sigma); } for (i in 1:num_elements(log_lik)) { log_lik[i] = normal_lpdf(y[i] | mu[i], sigma); } } mod1 &lt;- stan_model(&quot;stan/lm_normal_1.stan&quot;) See the Stan Modeling Language User’s Guide and Reference Manual for details of the Stan Language. NoteSince a Stan model compiles to C++ code, you may receive some warning messages such as /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/library/StanHeaders/include/stan/math/rev/core/set_zero_all_adjoints.hpp:14:17: warning: unused function &#39;set_zero_all_adjoints&#39; [-Wunused-function] static void set_zero_all_adjoints() { ^ In file included from file1d4a4d50faa.cpp:8: In file included from /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/library/StanHeaders/include/src/stan/model/model_header.hpp:4: As long as your model compiles, you can ignore these compiler warnings (On the other hard, warnings that occur during sampling should not be ignored). If the Stan model does not give you a syntax error when parsing the model, it should compile to valid C++.[^bugs][^c-warnings] See [bugs]: In the rare case that the Stan parser transpiles the Stan model to C++ but cannot compile the C++ code, it is a bug in Stan. Follow the instructions on how to inform the Stan developers about bugs. [c-warnings]: The extended installation instructions for MacOS/Linux and Windows have instructions for adding compiler options to the R Makevars file. 11.3.1 Sampling In order to sample from the model, we need to at least give it the values for the data to use: `,k,y,X`, and the data associated with the priors. The data types in Stan are all numeric (either integers or reals), but they include matrices and vectors. However, there is nothing like a data frame in Stan. Whereas in the R function lm we can provide a formula and a data set for where to look for objects, and the function will create the appropriate \\(X\\) matrix for the regression, we will need to create that matrix ourselves—expanding categorical variables to indicator variables, and expanding interactions and other functions of the predictors. rec &lt;- recipe(prestige ~ income + education + type, data = Duncan) %&gt;% step_dummy(type) %&gt;% prep(data = Duncan, retain = TRUE) X &lt;- juice(rec, all_predictors(), composition = &quot;matrix&quot;) y &lt;- drop(juice(rec, all_outcomes(), composition = &quot;matrix&quot;)) mod1_data &lt;- list( X = X, K = ncol(X), N = nrow(X), y = y, use_y_rep = FALSE, use_log_lik = FALSE ) We still need to provide the values for the prior distributions. For specific values of the prior distributions, assume uninformative priors for beta by setting the mean to zero and the variances to large numbers. mod1_data$scale_alpha &lt;- sd(y) * 10 mod1_data$scale_beta &lt;- apply(X, 2, sd) * sd(y) * 2.5 mod1_data$loc_sigma &lt;- sd(y) Now, sample from the posterior, using the function sampling: mod1_fit &lt;- sampling(mod1, data = mod1_data) summary(mod1_fit) #&gt;

In GLMs, the mean is specified as a function of a linear model of predictors, \\[ E(Y) = \\mu = g^{-1}(\\mat{X} \\vec{\\beta}) . \\] GLMs are a generalization of linear regression from an unbounded continuous outcome variable to other types of data: binary, count, categorical, bounded continuous. A GLM consists of three components: A probability distribution (family) specifying the conditional distribution of the response variable. In GLMs, the distribution is in the exponential family: Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Categorical, Multinomial, Poisson, Beta. A linear predictor, which is a linear function of the predictors, \\[ \\eta = \\mat{X} \\vec{\\beta}. \\] A link function (\\(g(.)\\)) which maps the expected value to the the linear predictor, \\[ g(\\mu) = \\eta . \\] The link function is smooth and invertible, and the inverse link function or mean function maps the linear predictor to the mean, \\[ \\mu = g^{-1}(\\eta) . \\] The link function (\\(g\\)) and its inverse ($g^{-1}) translate \\(\\eta\\) from \\((\\-infty, +\\infty)\\) to the proper range for the probability distribution and back again. These models are often estimated with MLE, as with the function stats. These are also easily estimated in a Bayesian setting. See the help for stats for common probability distributions, stats for common links, and the Wikipedia page for a table of common GLMs. See the function VGAM for even more examples of link functions and probability distributions. 12.2 Count Models 12.2.1 Poisson The Poisson model is used for unbounded count data, \\[ Y = 0, 1, \\dots, \\infty \\] The outcome is modeled as a Poisson distribution \\[ y_i \\sim \\dpois(\\lambda_i) \\] with positive mean parameter \\(\\lambda_i \\in (0, \\infty)\\). Since \\(\\lambda_i\\) has to be positive, the most common link function is the log, \\[ \\log(\\lambda_i) = \\exp(\\vec{x}_i&#39; \\vec{\\beta}) \\] which has the inverse, \\[ \\lambda_i = \\log(\\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\beta}) \\] In Stan, the Poisson distribution has two implementations: poisson_lpdf poisson_log_lpdf: Poisson with a log link. This is for numeric stability. Also, rstanarm supports the Poisson. 12.3 Example A regression model of bilateral sanctions for the period 1939 to 1983. The outcome variable is the number of countries imposing sanctions. data(&quot;sanction&quot;, package = &quot;Zelig&quot;) TODO 12.4 Negative Binomial The Negative Binomial model is also used for unbounded count data, \\[ Y = 0, 1, \\dots, \\infty \\] The Poisson distribution has the restriction that the mean is equal to the variance, \\(\\E(X) = \\Var(X) = \\lambda\\). The Negative Binomial distribution has an additional parameter that allows the variance to vary (though it is always larger than the mean). The outcome is modeled as a negative binomial distribution, \\[ y_i \\sim \\dbinom(\\alpha_i, \\beta) \\] with shape \\(\\alpha \\in \\R^{+}\\) and inverse scale \\(\\beta \\in \\R^{+}\\), and \\(\\E(y) = \\alpha_i / \\beta\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\frac{\\alpha_i}{\\beta^2}(\\beta + 1)\\). Then the mean can be modeled and transformed to the \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\mu_i &amp;= \\log( \\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\gamma} ) \\\\ \\alpha_i &amp;= \\mu_i / \\beta \\end{aligned} \\] Important The negative binomial distribution has many different parameterizations. An alternative parameterization of the negative binomial uses the mean and a over-dispersion parameter. \\[ y_i \\sim \\dnbinomalt(\\mu_i, \\phi) \\] with location parameter \\(\\mu \\in \\R^{+}\\) and over-dispersion parameter \\(\\phi \\in \\R^{+}\\), and \\(\\E(y) = \\mu_i\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\mu_i + \\frac{\\mu_i^2}{\\phi}\\). Then the mean can be modeled and transformed to the \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\mu_i &amp;= \\log( \\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\gamma} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] In Stan, there are multiple parameterizations of the neg_binomial_lpdf(y | alpha, beta)with shape parameter alpha and inverse scale parameter beta. neg_binomial_2_lpdf(y | mu, phi) with mean mu and over-dispersion parameter phi. neg_binomial_2_log_lpdf(y | eta, phi) with log-mean eta and over-dispersion parameter phi Also, rstanarm supports Poisson and negative binomial models. A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Ch 16) 12.5 Multinomial / Categorical Models 12.6 Gamma Regression The response variable is continuous and positive. In gamma regression, the coefficient of variation is constant rather than the variance. \\[ y_i \\sim \\dgamma(\\alpha_i, \\beta) \\] and \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\alpha_i &amp;= \\mu_i / \\beta \\\\ \\mu_i &amp;= \\vec{x}_i \\vec{\\gamma} \\end{aligned} \\] In Stan, gamma(y | alpha, beta) with shape parameter \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\) and inverse scale parameter \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\). Then \\(\\E(Y) = \\alpha / \\beta\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\alpha / \\beta^2\\). 12.7 Beta Regression This is for a response variable that is a proportion, \\(y_i \\in (0, 1)\\), \\[ y_i \\sim \\dbeta(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i) \\] and \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\mu_i &amp;= g^{-1}(\\vec{x}_i&#39; \\vec{\\gamma}) \\\\ \\alpha_i &amp;= \\mu_i \\phi \\\\ \\beta_i &amp;= (1 - \\mu_i) \\phi \\end{aligned} \\] Additionally, the \\(\\phi\\) parameter could also be modeled. In Stan: beta(y | alpha, beta) with positive prior successes plus one, \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), and negative prior failures plus one, \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\). Then \\(\\E(Y) = \\alpha / (\\alpha + \\beta)\\) and \\(\\Var(Y) = \\alpha\\beta / ((\\alpha + \\beta)^2 (\\alpha + \\beta + 1))\\). rstanarm function rstasnarm See: Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004), Cribari-Neto and Zeileis (2010), and Grün, Kosmidis, and Zeileis (2012) on beta regression. rstanarm documentation Modeling Rates/Proportions using Beta Regression with rstanarm 12.8 References For general references on count models see A.

For classification problems, there are three cases. complete separation: the predictor perfectly predicts both 0’s and 1’s. quasi-complete separation: the predictor perfectly predicts either 0’s or 1’s. overlap: the predictor does not perfectly predict either 0’s or 1’s. Both complete separation and quasi-complete separation cause problems for binomial maximum likelihood estimators. 14.2 Complete Separation The following data is an example of data with complete separation.10 CompleteSeparation #&gt; # A tibble: 8 x 3 #&gt; y x1 x2 #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 0 1 3 #&gt; 2 0 2 2 #&gt; 3 0 3 -1 #&gt; 4 0 3 -1 #&gt; 5 1 5 2 #&gt; 6 1 6 4 #&gt; # ... with 2 more rows count(CompleteSeparation, y, x1) %&gt;% group_by(x1) %&gt;% mutate(p = n / sum(n)) %&gt;% select(-n) %&gt;% spread(y, p, fill = 0) #&gt; # A tibble: 7 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: x1 [7] #&gt; x1 `0` `1` #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 1 0 #&gt; 2 2 1 0 #&gt; 3 3 1 0 #&gt; 4 5 0 1 #&gt; 5 6 0 1 #&gt; 6 10 0 1 #&gt; # ... with 1 more row The variable x1 perfectly separates y, since when x1 &lt;= 3, y = 0, and when x1 &gt; 3, y = 1. The MLE of the binomial likelihood with a logistic link function for this data has a finite log-likelihood, but the optimal line is a step function.

These are the priors suggested by Stan and used by default in rstanarm rstanarm.

Rainey (2016) provides a mixed MLE/Bayesian simulation based approach to apply a prior to the variable with separation, while keeping the other coefficients at their MLE values. Since the results are highly sensitive to the prior, multiple priors should be tried (informative, skeptical, and enthusiastic). Firth (1993) suggests a data-driven Jeffreys invariant prior. This prior was also recommended in Zorn (2005). Greenland and Mansournia (2015) suggest a log-F prior distribution which has an intuitive interpretation related to the number of observations.

This is because the normal distribution has narrow tail probabilities, with approximately 99.8% of the probability within three standard deviations. Robust regression refers to regression methods which are less sensitive to outliers. Bayesian robust regression uses distributions with wider tails than the normal instead of the normal. This plots the normal, Double Exponential (Laplace), and Student-t (\\(df = 4\\)) distributions all with mean 0 and scale 1, and the surprise (\\(- log(p)\\)) at each point. Both the Student-\\(t\\) and Double Exponential distributions have surprise values well below the normal in the ranges (-6, 6).11 This means that outliers will have less of an affect on the log-posterior of models using these distributions. The regression line would need to move less incorporate those observations since the error distribution will not consider them as unusual. 15.2 Student-t distribution The most commonly used Bayesian model for robust regression is a linear regression with independent Student-\\(t\\) errors (Geweke 1993; A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. 2013, Ch. 17): \\[ y_i \\sim \\dt\\left(\\nu, \\mu_i, \\sigma \\right) \\] where \\(\\nu \\in \\R^{+}\\) is a degrees of freedom parameter, \\(\\mu_i \\in \\R\\) are observation specific locations often modeled with a regression, and and \\(\\sigma \\in R^{+}\\) is a the scale parameter. Note that as \\(\\nu \\to \\infty\\), this model approaches an independent normal model, since the Student-t distribution asymptotically approaches the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increases. For the value of \\(\\nu\\), either a low degrees of freedom \\(\\nu \\in (4, 6)\\) can be used, or it can be given a prior distribution. For the Student-t distribution, the existence of various moments depends on the value of \\(\\nu\\): the mean exists for \\(\\nu &gt; 1\\), variance for \\(\\nu &gt; 2\\), and kurtosis for \\(\\nu &gt; 3\\). As such, it is often useful to restrict the support of \\(\\nu\\) to at least 1 or 2 (or even higher) ensure the existence of a mean or variance. A reasonable prior distribution for the degrees of freedom parameter is a Gamma distribution with shape parameter 2, and an inverse-scale (rate) parameter of 0.1 (Juárez and Steel 2010,@Stan-prior-choices), \\[ \\nu \\sim \\dgamma(2, 0.1) . \\] This density places the majority of the prior mass for values \\(\\nu &lt; 50\\), in which the Student-\\(t\\) distribution is substantively different from the Normal distribution, and also allows for all prior moments to exist. The Stan model that estimates this is lm_student_t_1.stan: // lm_student_t_1.stan // Linear Model with Student-t Errors data { // number of observations int N; // response vector[N] y; // number of columns in the design matrix X int K; // design matrix X // should not include an intercept matrix [N, K] X; // priors on alpha real scale_alpha; vector[K] scale_beta; real loc_sigma; // keep responses int use_y_rep; int use_log_lik; } parameters { // regression coefficient vector real alpha; vector[K] beta; real sigma; // degrees of freedom; // limit df = 2 so that there is a finite variance real nu; } transformed parameters { vector[N] mu; mu = alpha + X * beta; } model { // priors alpha ~ normal(0.0, scale_alpha); beta ~ normal(0.0, scale_beta); sigma ~ exponential(loc_sigma); // see Stan prior distribution suggestions nu ~ gamma(2, 0.1); // likelihood y ~ student_t(nu, mu, sigma); } generated quantities { // simulate data from the posterior vector[N * use_y_rep] y_rep; // log-likelihood posterior vector[N * use_log_lik] log_lik; for (i in 1:num_elements(y_rep)) { y_rep[i] = student_t_rng(nu, mu[i], sigma); } for (i in 1:num_elements(log_lik)) { log_lik[i] = student_t_lpdf(y[i] | nu, mu[i], sigma); } } As noted in Heteroskedasticity, the Student-t distribution can be represented as a scale-mixture of normal distributions, where the inverse-variances (precisions) follow a Gamma distribution, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y_i &amp;\\sim \\dnorm\\left(\\mu_i, \\omega^2 \\lambda_i^2 \\right) \\\\ \\lambda^{-2} &amp;\\sim \\dgamma\\left(\\nu / 2, \\nu / 2\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] The scale mixture distribution of normal parameterization of the Student t distribution is useful for computational reasons. A Stan model that implements this scale mixture of normal distribution representation of the Student-t distribution is lm_student_t_2.stan: // lm_student_t_2.stan // Linear Model with Student-t Errors data { // number of observations int N; // response vector[N] y; // number of columns in the design matrix X int K; // design matrix X // should not include an intercept matrix [N, K] X; // priors on alpha real scale_alpha; vector[K] scale_beta; real loc_sigma; // keep responses int use_y_rep; int use_log_lik; } parameters { // regression coefficient vector real alpha; vector[K] beta; // regression scale real omega; // 1 / lambda_i^2 vector[N] inv_lambda2; // degrees of freedom; // limit df = 2 so that there is a finite variance real nu; } transformed parameters { vector[N] mu; mu = alpha + X * beta; } model { real half_nu; vector[N] sigma; // priors alpha ~ normal(0.0, scale_alpha); beta ~ normal(0.0, scale_beta); sigma ~ exponential(loc_sigma); nu ~ gamma(2, 0.1); half_nu = 0.5 * nu; inv_lambda2 ~ gamma(half_nu, half_nu); // observation variances for (n in 1:N) { sigma[n] = omega / sqrt(inv_lambda2[n]); } // likelihood with obs specific scales y ~ normal(mu, sigma); } generated quantities { // simulate data from the posterior vector[N * use_y_rep] y_rep; // log-likelihood posterior vector[N * use_log_lik] log_lik; for (n in 1:num_elements(y_rep)) { y_rep[n] = student_t_rng(nu, mu[n], omega); } for (n in 1:num_elements(log_lik)) { log_lik[n] = student_t_lpdf(y[n] | nu, mu[n], omega); } } Another reparameterization of these models that is useful computationally is The variance of the Student-t distribution is a function of the scale and the degree-of-freedom parameters. Suppose \\(X \\sim \\dt(\\nu, \\mu, \\sigma)\\), then \\[ \\Var(X) = \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - 2} \\sigma^2. \\] So variance of data can be fit better by either increasing \\(\\nu\\) or increasing the scale \\(\\sigma\\). This will create posterior correlations between the parameters, and make it more difficult to sample the posterior distribution. We can reparameterize the model to make \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\nu\\) less correlated by multiplying the scale by the degrees of freedom. \\[ \\begin{aligned} y_i \\sim \\dt\\left(\\nu, \\mu_i, \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu - 2}{\\nu}} \\right) \\end{aligned} \\] In this model, changing the value of \\(\\nu\\) has no effect on the variance of \\(y\\), since \\[ \\Var(y_i) = \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - 2} \\sigma^2 \\frac{\\nu - 2}{\\nu} = \\sigma^2 . \\] 15.2.1 Examples Estimate some examples with known outliers and compare to using a normal See the data examples income_ineq, unionization, and econ_growth in the associated jrnold.bayes.notes package. 15.3 Robit The “robit” is a “robust” bivariate model.(A. Gelman and Hill 2007, 125; Liu 2005) For the link-function the robit uses the CDF of the Student-t distribution with \\(d\\) degrees of freedom. \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y_i &amp;\\sim \\dbin \\left(n_i, \\pi_i \\right) \\\\ \\pi_i &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\eta_i} \\mathsf{StudentT}(x | \\nu, 0, (\\nu - 2)/ \\nu) dx \\\\ \\eta_i &amp;= \\alpha + X \\beta \\end{aligned} \\] Since the variance of a random variable distributed Student-\\(t\\) is \\(d / d - 2\\), the scale fixes the variance of the distribution at 1. Fixing the variance of the Student-\\(t\\) distribution is not necessary if \\(d\\) is fixed, but is necessary if \\(d\\) were modeled as a parameter. Where \\(\\nu\\) is given a low degrees of freedom \\(\\nu \\in [3, 7]\\), or a prior distribution. 15.4 Quantile regression A different form of robust regression and one that often serves a different purpose is quantile regression. Least absolute deviation (LAD) regression minimizes the following objective function, \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_{LAD} = \\arg \\min_{\\beta} \\sum | y_i - \\alpha - X \\beta | . \\] The Bayesian analog is the Laplace distribution, \\[ \\dlaplace(x | \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{2 \\sigma} \\left( - \\frac{|x - \\mu|}{\\sigma} \\right) . \\] The Laplace distribution is analogous to least absolute deviations because the kernel of the distribution is \\(|x - \\mu|\\), so minimizing the likelihood will also minimize the least absolute distances. Thus, a linear regression with Laplace errors is analogous to a median regression. \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y_i &amp;\\sim \\dlaplace\\left( \\alpha + X \\beta, \\sigma \\right) \\end{aligned} \\] This can be generalized to other quantiles using the asymmetric Laplace distribution (Benoit and Poel 2017, @YuZhang2005a). 15.4.1 Questions OLS is a model of the conditional mean \\(E(y | x)\\). A linear model with normal errors is a model of the outcomes \\(p(y | x)\\). How would you estimate the conditional mean, median, and quantile functions from the linear-normal model? What role would quantile regression play? Hint: See Benoit and Poel (2017 Sec. 3.4). Implement the asymmetric Laplace distribution in Stan in two ways: Write a user function to calculate the log-PDF Implement it as a scale-mixture of normal distributions 15.5 References For more on robust regression see A. Gelman and Hill (2007 sec 6.6), A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 ch 17), and Stan Development Team (2016 Sec 8.4). For more on heteroskedasticity see A. Gelman, Carlin, et al. (2013 Sec. 14.7) for models with unequal variances and correlations. Stan Development Team (2016) discusses reparameterizing the Student t distribution as a mixture of gamma distributions in Stan.

If \\(\\sigma_i = 1\\) for all \\(i\\), then this corresponds to the classical homoskedastic linear regression. If \\(\\sigma_i\\) differs for each \\(i\\), then it is a heteroskedastic regression. In frequentist estimation linear regressions with heteroskedastic are often estimated using OLS with heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC) standard errors.12 However, HC standard errors are not a generative model, and in the Bayesian setting it is preferable to write a generative model that specifies a model for \\(\\sigma^2\\). 16.2 Weighted Regression A common case is “weighted” regression, where each \\(y_i\\) represents the mean of \\(n_i\\) observations. Then the scale of each observation is \\[ \\sigma_i = \\omega / n_i , \\] where \\(\\omega\\) is a global scale. Alternatively, suppose each observation represents the sum of each \\(n_i\\) observations. Then the scale of each observation is, \\[ \\sigma_i = n_i \\omega . \\] 16.3 Modeling the Scale with Covariates The scale can also be modeled with covariates. It is common to model the log-transformation of the scale or variance to transform it to \\(\\R\\), \\[ \\log \\sigma_i = \\dnorm(Z_i \\gamma, \\omega) \\] where \\(Z_i\\) are covariates used to the model the variance, which may or may not be the same as \\(X_i\\). Another common model is the variance as a function of the mean, \\[ \\begin{align} \\log \\sigma_i = f(\\mu_i). \\end{align} \\] Consider the well-known normal approximation of the binomial distribution, \\[ \\dnorm(n_i | N_i, \\pi_i) \\approx \\dnorm(n_i | \\pi N_i, \\pi (1 - \\pi) N_i) . \\] At the cost of treating the outcome as continuous rather than discrete, this approximation can provide a flexible model for over- or under-dispersion, by adding a dispersion term \\(\\delta \\in R^{+}\\), \\[ n_i \\sim \\dnorm(\\pi N_i, \\delta \\pi (1 - \\pi)) . \\] A similar approximation can be applied to unbounded count models using the normal approximation to the Poisson, \\(\\dpois(y_i | \\lambda_i) \\approx \\dnorm(y_i | \\lambda_i \\lambda_i)\\). 16.4 Prior Distributions A reparameterization that will be used quite often is to rewrite a normal distributions with unequal scale parameters as the product of a common global scale parameter (\\(\\omega\\)), and observation specific local scale parameters, \\(\\lambda_i\\),13 \\[ y_i \\sim \\dnorm(X\\beta, \\lambda_i \\omega) . \\] If the local variance parameters are distributed inverse-gamma, \\[ \\lambda^2 \\sim \\dinvgamma(\\nu / 2, \\nu / 2) \\] then the above is equivalent to a regression with errors distributed Student-t errors with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom, \\[ y_i \\sim \\dt\\left(\\nu, X \\beta, \\sigma \\right) . \\] Note that if a random variable \\(X\\) is distributed inverse-gamma, it is equivalent to \\(1 / X\\) being distributed gamma. In this example, \\[ \\dinvgamma(\\lambda^2 | \\nu / 2, \\nu / 2) = \\dgamma\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\middle| \\nu / 2, \\nu / 2\\right) = \\] Example: Simulate Student-\\(t\\) distribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom as a scale mixture of normal. For *s in 1:S$, Simulate \\(z_s \\sim \\dgamma(\\nu / 2, \\nu / 2)\\) \\(x_s = 1 / \\sqrt{z_s}\\) is draw from \\(\\dt(\\nu, 0, 1)\\). When using R, ensure that you are using the correct parameterization of the gamma distribution. Left to reader We can also model heteroskedasticity by placing a prior distribution on the variances. \\[ \\sigma_i = \\omega \\lambda_i . \\] Thus, the heteroskedastic likelihood is, \\[ y_i \\sim \\dnorm\\left( \\mu_i, \\omega^2 \\lambda_i^2\\right) \\] Note that since the number of \\(\\lambda_i\\) parameters are equal to the number of observations, this model will not have a proper posterior distribution without a proper prior distribution. However, if a proper prior is placed on \\(\\lambda_i\\), then the posterior distribution for this model exists. Suppose \\(1 / \\lambda_i^2\\) is distributed with a specific gamma distribution, \\[ 1 / \\lambda_i^2 \\sim \\dgamma(d / 2, d / 2) . \\] This \\[ \\dt(y_i | \\nu, \\mu_i, \\omega) = \\int \\dnorm(y | \\mu_i, \\omega^2 \\lambda^2) \\dinvgamma(\\nu / 2, \\nu / 2) d \\lambda^2 \\] This is equivalent to a regression model with Student-t errors. \\[ y_i \\sim \\dt\\left(d, ., \\omega \\right) . \\] Thus, “robust” regression models with Student-\\(t\\) errors can be derived from a particular model of heteroskedastic normal errors. The Stan model that estimates this is lm_student_t_1.stan: // lm_student_t_1.stan // Linear Model with Student-t Errors data { // number of observations int N; // response vector[N] y; // number of columns in the design matrix X int K; // design matrix X // should not include an intercept matrix [N, K] X; // priors on alpha real scale_alpha; vector[K] scale_beta; real loc_sigma; // keep responses int use_y_rep; int use_log_lik; } parameters { // regression coefficient vector real alpha; vector[K] beta; real sigma; // degrees of freedom; // limit df = 2 so that there is a finite variance real nu; } transformed parameters { vector[N] mu; mu = alpha + X * beta; } model { // priors alpha ~ normal(0.0, scale_alpha); beta ~ normal(0.0, scale_beta); sigma ~ exponential(loc_sigma); // see Stan prior distribution suggestions nu ~ gamma(2, 0.1); // likelihood y ~ student_t(nu, mu, sigma); } generated quantities { // simulate data from the posterior vector[N * use_y_rep] y_rep; // log-likelihood posterior vector[N * use_log_lik] log_lik; for (i in 1:num_elements(y_rep)) { y_rep[i] = student_t_rng(nu, mu[i], sigma); } for (i in 1:num_elements(log_lik)) { log_lik[i] = student_t_lpdf(y[i] | nu, mu[i], sigma); } } We could also apply other prior distributions to the Another flexible model of heteroskedasticity is to apply a Dirichlet model to the local scales, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\lambda_i &amp;\\sim \\ddirichlet(a, w), &amp; \\lambda_i \\geq 0, \\sum_i \\lambda_i = 1 . \\end{aligned} \\] 16.4.1 Examples: Duncan Estimate the linear regression with the Duncan data using heteroskedastic errors. data(&quot;Duncan&quot;, package = &quot;carData&quot;) mod_norm &lt;- stan_model(&quot;stan/lm_normal_1.stan&quot;, verbose = FALSE) mod_t &lt;- stan_model(&quot;stan/lm_student_t_1.stan&quot;, verbose = FALSE) 16.5 Exercises Estimate examples in the hett package with Stan. 16.6 References For more on heteroskedasticity see A.

["rare-events.html", "17 Rare Events Prerequisites 17.1 Introduction 17.2 Finite-Sample Bias 17.3 Case Control 17.4 Questions", " 17 Rare Events Prerequisites library(&quot;rstan&quot;) library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) 17.1 Introduction There are two issues when estimating model with a binary outcomes and rare events. Bias due to an effective small sample size: The solution to this is the same as quasi-separation, a weakly informative prior on the coefficients, as discussed in the Separation chapter. Case-control: Adding additional observations to the majority class adds little additional information. If it is costly to acquire training data, it is better to acquire something closer to a balanced training set: approximately equal numbers of 0’s and 1’s. The model can be adjusted for this bias. 17.2 Finite-Sample Bias The finite-sample size bias can handled by the use of weakly informative priors as discussed in the chapter on separation. The current best-practice in Stan is to use the following weakly informative priors for the intercept and coefficients: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\alpha &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(0, 10)\\\\ \\beta_k &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(0, 2.5) \\end{aligned} \\] The Normal priors could be replaced by Student-\\(t\\) priors with finite variance. 17.3 Case Control In binary outcome variables, sometimes it is useful to sample on the dependent variable. For example, King and Zeng (2001b) and King and Zeng (2001a) discuss applications with respect to conflicts in international relations. For most country-pairs, for most years, there is no conflict. If some data are costly to gather, it may be cost efficient to gather data for conflict-years and then randomly select a smaller number of non-conflict years on which to gather data. The sample will no longer be representative, but the estimates can be corrected to account for the data-generating process. The reason this works well, is that if there are few 1’s, additional 0’s have little influence on the estimation (King and Zeng (2001b)). King and Zeng (2001b) propose two corrections: Prior correction Weighting observations The prior correction model adjust the intercept of the logit model to account for the difference between the sample and population proportions. Note that \\[ \\pi_i = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\alpha + \\mat{X} \\beta)} \\] An unbalanced sample only affects the intercept. If \\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept estimated on the sample, the prior corrected intercept \\(\\tilde{\\alpha}\\) is, \\[ \\tilde{\\alpha} = \\alpha - \\ln \\left(\\frac{1 - \\tau}{\\tau} \\frac{\\bar{y}}{1 - \\bar{y}} \\right) \\] This is a special case of using an offset in a generalized linear model. Since this constant is added to all observations it will not affect the estimation of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), but it will adjust the predicted probabilities for observations in the sample and new observations. Thus the complete specification of a prior-correction rare event logits with standard weakly informative priors is: \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y_i&amp; \\sim \\dbernoulli(\\pi_i) \\\\ \\pi_i &amp;= \\invlogit(\\eta_i) \\\\ \\eta_i &amp;= \\tilde{\\alpha} + X \\beta \\\\ \\tilde{\\alpha} &amp;= \\alpha - \\ln \\left(\\frac{(1 - \\tau) \\bar{y}}{\\tau (1 - \\bar{y})} \\right) \\\\ \\alpha &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(0, 10) \\\\ \\beta &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(0, 2.5) \\end{aligned} \\] This is implemented in relogit1.stan: // relogit1.stan // Rare-Events Logit Model with Prior Correction data { // number of observations int N; // response // vectors are only real numbers // need to use an array int y[N]; // need to pass mean of y since it is hard to cast integer to real types // in stan real y_mean; // number of columns in the design matrix X int K; // design matrix X // should not include an intercept matrix [N, K] X; // priors on alpha real scale_alpha; real scale_beta; // rare-event logit correction // population proportion of outcomes real tau; // keep responses int use_y_rep; int use_log_lik; } transformed data { real correction; // log((y_mean) / (1 - ymean) * tau / (1 - tau)) correction = log(y_mean) - log1m(y_mean) + log1m(tau) - log(tau); } parameters { // regression coefficient vector real alpha_raw; vector[K] beta; } transformed parameters { // sampling corrected intercept real alpha; // logit-scale means vector[N] eta; alpha = alpha_raw - correction; eta = alpha + X * beta; } model { // priors alpha_raw ~ normal(0., scale_alpha); beta ~ normal(0., scale_beta); // likelihood y ~ bernoulli_logit(eta); } generated quantities { // simulate data from the posterior // actually simulate proportions rather than the outcomes - these are easy // enough to create. vector[N * use_y_rep] y_rep; // log-likelihood posterior vector[N * use_log_lik] log_lik; for (i in 1:num_elements(y_rep)) { y_rep[i] = bernoulli_rng(inv_logit(eta[i])); } for (i in 1:num_elements(log_lik)) { log_lik[i] = bernoulli_lpmf(y[i] | inv_logit(eta[i])); } } The weighted likelihood model weights the contributions of each observation to the likelihood with its probability of selection. As before, let \\(\\mean{y}\\) be the sample proportion of 1s in outcome, and \\(\\tau\\) be the known population proportion. The probability of selection, conditional on the outcome is, \\[ w_i = \\begin{cases} \\tau / \\bar{y} &amp; \\text{if } y_i = 1 \\text{,} \\\\ (1 - \\tau) / (1 - \\bar{y}) &amp; \\text{if } y_i = 0 \\text{.} \\end{cases} \\] The log-likelihood is written as a weighted log-likelihood: \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\log L_w(\\beta | y) &amp;= \\sum_i w_i \\log \\dbern (\\pi_i) \\end{aligned} \\] In Stan, this can be implemented by directly weighting the log-posterior contributions of each observation. This is implemented in relogit2.stan: // relogit2.stan // Rare-Events Logit Model with Prior Correction data { // number of observations int N; // response // vectors are only real numbers // need to use an array int y[N]; // number of columns in the design matrix X int K; // design matrix X // should not include an intercept matrix [N, K] X; // priors on alpha real scale_alpha; real scale_beta; // rare-event logit correction // population proportion of outcomes real tau; // need to pass mean of y since it is hard to cast integer to real types // in stan real y_mean; // keep responses int use_y_rep; int use_log_lik; } transformed data { // weights vector[N] w; for (n in 1:N) { if (y[n]) { w[n] = tau / y_mean; } else { w[n] = (1. - tau) / (1. - y_mean); } } } parameters { // regression coefficient vector real alpha; vector[K] beta; } transformed parameters { // logit-scale means vector[N] eta; eta = alpha + X * beta; } model { // priors alpha ~ normal(0.0, scale_alpha); beta ~ normal(0.0, scale_beta); // manually calculate the weighted log-likelihood for (n in 1:N) { target += w[n] * bernoulli_logit_lpmf(y[n] | eta[n]); } } generated quantities { // simulate data from the posterior // actually simulate proportions rather than the outcomes - these are easy // enough to create. vector[N * use_y_rep] y_rep; // log-likelihood posterior vector[N * use_log_lik] log_lik; for (i in 1:num_elements(y_rep)) { y_rep[i] = bernoulli_rng(inv_logit(eta[i])); } // we don't need to weight the individual log-likelihoods for (i in 1:num_elements(log_lik)) { log_lik[i] = bernoulli_lpmf(y[i] | inv_logit(eta[i])); } } 17.4 Questions Compare the estimates and efficiency of the two methods. How would you evaluate the predictive distributions using cross-validation in case of unbalanced classes? Suppose that there is uncertainty about the population proportion, \\(\\tau\\). Incorporate that uncertainty into the model by making \\(\\tau\\) a parameter and giving it a prior distribution. In the prior correction method, instead of adjust the intercept prior to sampling, it could be done after sampling. Calculate the corrected intercept to the generated quantities block. Does it change the estimates? Does it change the efficiency of sampling? See the example for Zelig-relogit "],

Prerequisites library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(&quot;rstan&quot;) library(&quot;loo&quot;) 18.1 Example: Baseball Hits Efron and Morris (1975) analyzed data from 18 players in the 1970 season. The goal was to predict the batting average of these 18 players from their first 45 at-bats for the remainder of the 1970 season. The following example is based on Carpenter, Gabry, and Goodrich (2017) and the rstanarm vignette Hierarchical Partial Pooling for Repeated Binary Trials. The hitting data used in Efron and Morris (1975) is included in rstanarm as rstanarm: data(&quot;bball1970&quot;, package = &quot;rstanarm&quot;) bball1970 &lt;- mutate(bball1970, BatAvg1 = Hits / AB, BatAvg2 = RemainingHits / RemainingAB) head(bball1970) #&gt; Player AB Hits RemainingAB RemainingHits BatAvg1 BatAvg2 #&gt; 1 Clemente 45 18 367 127 0.400 0.346 #&gt; 2 Robinson 45 17 426 127 0.378 0.298 #&gt; 3 Howard 45 16 521 144 0.356 0.276 #&gt; 4 Johnstone 45 15 275 61 0.333 0.222 #&gt; 5 Berry 45 14 418 114 0.311 0.273 #&gt; 6 Spencer 45 14 466 126 0.311 0.270 Let \\(y_i\\) be the number of hits in the first 45 at bats for player \\(i\\), \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] y_i &amp; \\sim \\dbin(45, \\mu_i), \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\mu_i \\in (0, 1)\\) is the player-specific batting average.

Non-pooled: Each players (log-odds) batting average is independent, with each assigned a separate weak prior. \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\eta_i &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(0, 2.5) \\end{aligned} \\] Partial-pooling: Each player has a separate (log-odds) batting average, but these batting average parameters are drawn from a common normal distribution. \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\eta_i &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(0, \\tau) \\\\ \\tau &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(0, 1) \\end{aligned} \\] bball1970_data &lt;- list( N = nrow(bball1970), k = bball1970$AB, y = bball1970$Hits, k_new = bball1970$RemainingAB, y_new = bball1970$RemainingHits ) Create a list to store models: models &lt;- list() models[[&quot;nopool&quot;]] &lt;- stan_model(&quot;stan/binomial-no-pooling.stan&quot;) models[[&quot;nopool&quot;]] prelist(class = “stan”)list(list(name = “code”, attribs = list(), children = list(“/* Binomial Model (No pooling)A binomial model for \\(i = 1, \\\\dots, N\\), no pooling:\\[\\n p(y_i | n_i, \\\\mu_i) &amp;\\\\sim \\\\mathsf{Binomial}(y_i | n_i, \\\\mu_i) \\\\\\\\\\n \\\\mu_i &amp;= \\\\logit^{-1}(\\\\eta_i) \\\\\\\\\\n p(\\\\eta_i) &amp;\\\\sim \\\\mathsf{Normal}^+(0, 10)\\n \\]/quantities {int y_rep[N];vector[N] log_lik;vector[N] log_lik_new;vector&lt;lower = 0., upper = 1.&gt;[N] mu;mu = inv_logit(eta);for (n in 1:N) {y_rep[n] = binomial_rng(k[n], mu[n]);log_lik[n] = binomial_logit_lpmf(y[n] | k[n], eta[n]);log_lik_new[n] = binomial_logit_lpmf(y_new[n] | k_new[n], eta[n]);}}”))) models[[&quot;pool&quot;]] &lt;- stan_model(&quot;stan/binomial-complete-pooling.stan&quot;) models[[&quot;pool&quot;]] prelist(class = “stan”)list(list(name = “code”, attribs = list(), children = list(“/* Binomial ModelA binomial model for \\(i = 1, \\\\dots, N\\), with complete pooling\\[\\n \\\\begin{aligned}[t]\\n p(y_i | n_i, \\\\mu) &amp;\\\\sim \\\\mathsf{Binomial}(n_i, \\\\mu) \\\\\\\\\\n \\\\mu &amp;= \\\\logit^{-1}(\\\\eta) \\\\\\\\\\n p(\\\\eta) &amp;\\\\sim \\\\mathsf{Normal}^+(0, 10)\\n \\\\end{aligned}\\n \\]/quantities {int y_rep[N];vector[N] log_lik;vector[N] log_lik_new;real&lt;lower = 0., upper = 1.&gt; mu;mu = inv_logit(eta);for (n in 1:N) { //y_rep[n] = binomial_rng(k[n], mu);log_lik[n] = binomial_logit_lpmf(y[n] | k[n], eta);log_lik_new[n] = binomial_logit_lpmf(y_new[n] | k_new[n], eta);}}”))) models[[&quot;partial&quot;]] &lt;- stan_model(&quot;stan/binomial-partial-pooling-t.stan&quot;) # models[[&quot;partial&quot;]] Sample from all three models a fits &lt;- map(models, sampling, data = bball1970_data, refresh = -1) %&gt;% set_names(names(models)) For each model calculate the posterior mean of \\(\\mu\\) for each player: bball1970 &lt;- map2_df(names(fits), fits, function(nm, fit) { mu &lt;- broom::tidy(fit) %&gt;% filter(str_detect(term, &quot;^mu&quot;)) if (nrow(mu) == 1) { out &lt;- tibble(estimate = rep(mu$estimate, 18L)) } else { out &lt;- select(mu, estimate) } out$model &lt;- nm out$.id &lt;- seq_len(nrow(out)) out }) %&gt;% spread(model, estimate) %&gt;% bind_cols(bball1970) The partially pooled estimates are shrunk towards the overall average, and are between the no-pooling and pooled estimates. select(bball1970, Player, nopool, partial, pool) %&gt;% mutate(Player = factor(Player, levels = Player)) %&gt;% gather(variable, value, -Player) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = value, x = factor(variable), group = Player)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = expression(mu)) We can plot the actual batting averages (BatAvg1 and BatAvg2) and the model estimates: select(bball1970, Player, nopool, partial, pool, BatAvg1, BatAvg2) %&gt;% mutate(Player = factor(Player, levels = Player)) %&gt;% gather(variable, value, -Player) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = Player, x = value, colour = variable)) + geom_point() + labs(x = expression(mu), y = &quot;&quot;) The estimates of the no-pooling model is almost exactly the same as BatAvg1. The out-of-sample batting averages BatAvg2 show regression to the mean. For these models, compare the overall out-of-sample performance by calculating the actual average out-of-sample log-pointwise predictive density (lppd), and the expected lppd using LOO-PSIS. The LOO-PSIS estimates of the out-of-sample lppd are optimistic. However, they still show the pooling and partial estimates as superior to the no-pooling estimates. The actual out-of-sample average lppd for the partial pooled model is the best fitting. map2_df(names(fits), fits, function(nm, fit) { loo &lt;- loo(extract_log_lik(fit, &quot;log_lik&quot;)) ll_new &lt;- rstan::extract(fit)[[&quot;log_lik_new&quot;]] tibble(model = nm, loo = loo$elpd_loo / bball1970_data$N, ll_out = mean(log(colMeans(exp(ll_new))))) }) #&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 3 #&gt; model loo ll_out #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 nopool -3.23 -4.62 #&gt; 2 pool -2.58 -4.06 #&gt; 3 partial -2.60 -4.01 To see why this is the case, plot the average errors for each observation in- and out-of-sample. In-sample for the no-pooling model is zero, but it over-estimates (under-estimates) the players with the highest (lowest) batting averages in their first 45 at bats—this is regression to the mean. In sample, the partially pooling model shrinks the estimates towards the mean and reducing error. Out of sample, the errors of the partially pooled model are not much different than the no-pooling model, except that the extreme observations have lower errors. select(bball1970, Player, nopool, partial, pool, BatAvg1, BatAvg2) %&gt;% mutate(Player = as.integer(factor(Player, levels = Player))) %&gt;% gather(variable, value, -Player, -matches(&quot;BatAvg&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(`In-sample Errors` = value - BatAvg1, `Out-of-sample Errors` = value - BatAvg2) %&gt;% select(-matches(&quot;BatAvg&quot;), -value) %&gt;% gather(sample, error, -variable, -Player) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = error, x = Player, colour = variable)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = &quot;white&quot;, size = 2) + geom_point() + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ sample, ncol = 1) + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) Extensions: Redo this analysis with the rstanarm dataset with hits and at-bats for the entire 2006 AL season of MLB. Use a beta distribution for the prior of \\(\\mu_i\\). How would you specify the prior beta distribution so that it is uninformative? If you used the beta distribution, how would you specify the beta distribution as a function of the mean? The lowest batting average of the modern era is approximately 0.16 and the highest is approximately 0.4. Use this information for an informative prior distribution. There may be some truly exceptional players. Model this by replacing the normal prior for \\(\\eta\\) with a wide tailed distribution. The distribution of batting averages may be asymmetric - since there may be a few great players, but a player can only be so bad before they are relegated to the minor league. Find a skewed distribution to use as a prior. 18.1.1 References Albert, Jim. Revisiting Efron and Morris’s Baseball Study Feb 15, 2016 Bob Carpenter.

This estimates models using maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood methods (REML). This will be faster than using full-Bayesian methods but also underestimate the uncertainty, as well as being a worse approximation of the posterior. Additionally, in frequentist inference, the meaning of the random effects is different; they are nuisance parameters and not given standard errors. See Bates (2010) and Bates et al. (2014) for introductions to mixed-effects models with lme4. These are also good introductions to classical approaches to mixed effects models. library(&quot;lme4&quot;) Complete pooling fit_pooled &lt;- lm(log_radon ~ county + floor, data = radon) County-varying intercepts with no-pooling fit_intercept_nopool &lt;- lm(log_radon ~ floor, data = radon) County-varying intercepts with partial-pooling fit_intercept_partial &lt;- lmer(log_radon ~ (1 | county) + floor, data = radon) Varying slopes with no pooling: fit_slope_nopool &lt;- lm(log_radon ~ county * floor, data = radon) Varying slopes with partial pooling: fit_slope_partial &lt;- lmer(log_radon ~ (1 + floor | county), data = radon) Including a county-level variable (log_uranium) in various models: With no-pooling, fit_slope_partial &lt;- lm(log_radon ~ floor + log_uranium, data = radon) With varying-intercepts fit_slope_partial &lt;- lmer(log_radon ~ (1 | county) + floor + log_uranium, data = radon) With varying-intercepts and slopes, fit_slope_partial &lt;- lmer(log_radon ~ (1 + floor | county) + log_uranium, data = radon) 19.1.7 rstanarm Some multilevel models can also be estimated using the rstanarm functions stan_glmer and stan_lmer.

Sample size, \\(n_j\\) Estimate of \\(\\hat{\\mu}_j\\) \\(n_j = 0\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}_j = \\gamma\\) (complete pooling) \\(n_j &lt; \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\tau^2}\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}_j\\) closer to \\(\\gamma\\) \\(n_j = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\tau^2}\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{y}_j + \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma\\) \\(n_j &gt; \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\tau^2}\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}_j\\) closer to \\(\\bar{y}_j\\) \\(n_j = \\infty\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}_j = \\bar{y}_j\\) (no pooling) If the hyperparameters were known, the posterior of \\(\\mu_j\\) is \\[ \\mu_j | y, \\gamma, \\sigma, \\tau \\sim \\dnorm(\\hat{\\mu}_j, V_j) \\] where \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] \\hat{\\mu}_j &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{n_j}{\\sigma^2} \\bar{y}_j + \\frac{1}{\\tau^2} \\gamma}{\\frac{n_j}{\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tau^2}} \\\\ V_j &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\frac{n_j}{\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tau^2}} \\end{aligned} \\] Some crude estimates given \\(\\mu_j\\).

In this case, both the time and units can be modeled. ## Extensions Including group-level covariates Prior distributions Prediction new obs in existing groups new group new obs in new group Modeling correlation between intercept and slopes Non-nested models 19.5 Miscellaneous 19.5.1 How many groups? In classical discussions of multi-level or hierarchical models, a common question is how many groups are required to be able to use random effects vs. fixed effects. As noted earlier, random effects estimates the variance between group means. If there are few groups, there is not much information available to estimate this variance. As such, random effects is not much different than fixed effects. This literature provides many different rules of thumb for the number of groups necessary to be able to use random effects: 8, 10, 30, 50, or 100 (Stegmueller 2013, 749). Stegmueller (2013) finds that Bayesian method produces better multi-level-models than maximum likelihood methods for all numbers of groups. ML methods do not suffer severe bias above 10-15 groups. Bayesian point estimates are biased for smaller numbers of groups, but less than the ML. Additionally, the Bayesian methods have better frequentist coverage than ML methods. Beck and Katz (2007) show that ML random coefficient models are superior in terms of efficiency to many types of pooled and un-pooled estimators in small samples. 19.5.2 Correlation between Predictors and Errors Bafumi and Gelman (2006) analyze this case. The standard suggestion in frequentist literature is to use a Hausman test where the null hypothesis is that random effects are consistent. However, Clark and Linzer (2014) note that in small samples this is likely to fail to reject random effects; and in large samples, random effects behave like fixed effects anyways. 19.6 References Texts and chapters on multi-level analysis: Bayesian A.

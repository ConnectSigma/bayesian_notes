In those cases, the posterior distribution is calculated exactly, and more costly numerical approximation methods do not need to be used. Unfortunately, these cases are few. Most of those cases involve conjugate priors. In the case of a conjugate prior, the posterior distribution is in the same family as the prior distribution. Here is a diagram of a few common conjugate priors.1 The table in the Wikipedia page for Conjugate priors is as complete as any out there. Fink (1997) for a compendium of references.

If \\(K \\in \\n\\), \\(N \\in \\N\\), and \\(\\theta \\in K-\\text{simplex}\\), then for \\(y \\in \\N^{K}\\) such that \\(\\sum_{k = 1}^K y_k = N\\), \\[ \\dmultinom(y | \\theta) = \\binom{N}{y_1, \\dots, y_K} \\prod_{k = 1}^{K} \\theta_k^{y_k}, \\] where the multinomial coefficient is defined as, \\[ \\binom{N}{y_1, \\dots, y_K} = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{k = 1}^K y_k!} \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(\\theta | \\alpha) &amp;= \\ddirichlet(\\theta | \\alpha) &amp;&amp; \\text{Dirichlet prior} \\\\ p(y | \\theta) &amp;= \\dmultinom(y | n, \\theta) &amp;&amp; \\text{Multinomial likelihood} \\\\ p(\\theta | y, \\alpha) &amp;= \\ddirichlet(\\theta | \\alpha + y) &amp;&amp; \\text{Dirichlet posterior} \\end{aligned} \\] 2.2.3 Poisson-Gamma Let \\(\\lambda\\) be the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution.

If a prior places probabilities of 0 or 1 on an event, then no amount of data can update that prior. The name, Cromwell’s Rule, comes from a quote of Oliver Cromwell, I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken. Lindley (1991) describes it as Leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese; it can be as small as 1 in a million, but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with samples of the said cheese will leave you unmoved. If \\(p(\\theta = x) = 0\\), then for a value of \\(x\\), then the posterior distribution is always zero. \\[ p(\\theta = x | y) \\propto p(y | \\theta = x) p(\\theta = x) = 0 \\] 2.5 Asymptotics As the sample size increases, the Bayesian distribution converges to a normal distribution centered on the true value of the parameter. Suppose data \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n \\sim\\) are an iid sample from the distribution \\(f(y)\\). Suppose that the data are modeled with a parametric family \\(p(y | \\theta)\\) and a prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\). If the data distribution is included in the parametric family, meaning that there exists a \\(\\theta_0\\) such that \\(p(y | \\theta_0) = f(y)\\), then the posterior distribution is consistent in that it converges to the true parameter value \\(\\theta_0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). Otherwise, the posterior convergences to the distribution \\(p(y | \\theta)\\) closes to the true distribution. As \\(n \\to infty\\), the likelihood dominates the posterior distribution. There are cases in which the normal approximation is incorrect. parameters are non-identified the number of parameters increases with sample size aliasing or non-identified parameters due to label switching unbounded likelihoods. This can happen if variance parameters go to zero. improper posterior distributions prior distributions that exclude the point of convergence. See Cromwell’s Rule. convergence to the edge of the parameter space tails of the distribution can be inaccurate even if the normal approximation converges to the correct value; e.g. the normal approximation will still place a non-zero density on negative values of a non-negative parameter. 2.6 Proper and Improper Priors A prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\) is an improper when it is not a probability distribution, meaning \\[ \\int p(\\theta) \\,d\\theta = \\infty . \\] Perhaps the most common improper distribution is an unbounded uniform distribution, \\[ p(\\theta) \\propto 1 \\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; \\theta &lt; \\infty\\). Improper priors can be used, because in some cases, the posterior distribution can still be proper even if the prior is not. Prior Posterior Improper ? Proper Proper One common case of this is a linear regression model with improper priors. \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X) = \\begin{cases} y &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(X \\beta, \\sigma^{2} I) \\end{cases} \\] If the number of observations (rows of \\(X\\)) is less than the number of independent columns in \\(X\\) (variables plus the constant), then the MLE of \\(\\beta\\) is undefined, and also the posterior distribution is improper. But if alter that model to include a proper prior, \\[ p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X) = \\begin{cases} y &amp;\\sim \\dnorm(X \\beta, \\sigma^{2} I) \\\\ \\beta &amp; \\sim \\dnorm(\\mu_\\beta, \\Sigma_\\beta) \\\\ \\gamma &amp;\\sim p(\\gamma) \\end{cases} \\] then we can estimate \\(p(\\beta, \\sigma | y, X)\\) even if the number of observations is less than the number of variables. Consider the case if we observe no data; then the posterior distribution is equal to the prior, and since the prior is a proper distribution, so is the posterior. However, because a proper posterior allows for estimating a posterior, does imply that the posterior distribution is any “good”. But that is the role of the evaluation step in Bayesian analysis. In the cases where an improper prior would lead to an improper posterior, the choice of the prior is important because the prior will dominate the shape of the posterior distribution. One way of thinking about many “identification” assumptions in MLE models is that they can loosely be considered “priors”. What is called the likelihood and what is called the the prior is not well-defined, and often the choice of of likelihood functions is both subjective and the most important part of the analysis. Regarding improper priors, also see the asymptotic results that the posterior distribution increasingly depends on the likelihood as sample size increases. Stan: If no prior distributions is specified for a parameter, it is given an improper prior distribution on \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\) after transforming the parameter to its constrained scale. 2.7 Hyperpriors and Hyperparameters A hyperparameter is a parameter in a prior. A hyperprior is a term for a prior on Consider the case of a binomial likelihood with a beta prior on the proportion parameter \\(\\theta\\). The observed value of \\(n\\) and the \\(N\\) \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(n | \\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dBinom(N, \\theta) &amp;&amp; \\text{likelihood for } n \\\\ p(\\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dbeta(a, b) &amp;&amp; \\text{prior on } \\theta \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] This is a model of the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) given the data, where the data consists of the \\(n\\) successes, the total number of trails \\(N\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the assumed shape parameters of the beta prior on \\(\\theta\\). Thus our posterior distribution is, \\[ p(\\theta | n, N, a, b) . \\] However, suppose we decided that since we did not have a good reason to choose any particular values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for the prior distribution, we would treat the shape parameters of the beta distribution as parameters and assign them their own prior distributions, \\[ \\begin{aligned}[t] p(n | \\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dBinom(N, \\theta) &amp;&amp; \\text{likelihood for } n \\\\ p(\\theta) &amp;\\sim \\dbeta(\\alpha, \\beta) &amp;&amp; \\text{prior on } \\theta \\\\ p(\\alpha) &amp;\\sim \\dexp(a^*) &amp;&amp; \\text{hyperprior} \\\\ p(\\beta) &amp;\\sim \\dexp(b^*) &amp;&amp; \\text{hyperprior} \\end{aligned} \\] Now the parameters of the model are \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\beta\\), and the data are \\(n\\), \\(N\\), \\(a^{*}\\), and \\(b^{*}\\). Since one parameter in the model (\\(\\theta\\)) is a function of other parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), we call \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) hyperparameters. 2.8 References Stan Wiki and the rstanarm vignette includes comprehensive advice for prior choice recommendations.

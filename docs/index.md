These notes are unfinished and certainly full of typos and such.
However, I'm no longer working on these notes.

Notes on Bayesian methods - written to supplement CS&SS/STAT 564: Bayesian Statistics for the Social Sciences.

These notes largely focus on the application and theory necessary for quantitative social scientists to successfully apply Bayesian statistical methods.

I also don't hesitate to link to those who have already explained things well, and focus my efforts on places where I haven't found good explanations (or explanations I understand), or places where I need to write notes to deepen my own understanding.

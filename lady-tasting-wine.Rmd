@Lindley considered the Bayesian analysis of Bayesian data using a variation of Fisher's "lady tasting tea" experiment.

1.  Suppose that the guesses are independent and drawn from the same underlying distribution parameterized by $\theta$, the probability that the lady is correct. What is the likelihood?
1.  Prior distribution Uniform(1,1). Use a conjugate prior to estimate this.
1.  Suppose that you think that the 
1.  Calculate a 95% confidence interval using the Wald formula. How does it differ from the Bayesian credible interval? 
1.  Conduct a hypothesis test at 5% significance level. What does this mean? Using the posterior distribution, calculate probability that $\theta > 0.5$? How does it differ from the Bayesian credible interval in values and interpretation?
1.  Suppose you think its reasonable that no one can do worse than chance. So you restrict the support of $\theta$ to $\frac{1}{5}$. Estimate the model using a grid of $\theta$ values.
1.  Estimate with Stan.

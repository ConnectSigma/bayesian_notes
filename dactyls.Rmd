# Estimating ANOVA Type Models

data("Dactyl", package = "HistData")
```

Edgeworth (1885) took the first 75 lines in Book XI of Virgil's Aeneid and classified each of the first four "feet" of the line as a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short ones) or not.

Grouping the lines in blocks of five gave a 4 x 25 table of counts, represented here as a data frame with ordered factors, Foot and Lines. Edgeworth used this table in what was among the first examples of analysis of variance applied to a two-way classification.

```{r}
stan_aov(count ~ Foot + Lines, data = Dactyl, prior = R2(location = 0.5))
```

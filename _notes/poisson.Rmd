Calculate the posterior distribution for different levels

Choose a prior equivalent to 1 kick in two years.
Estimate the posterior distribution

Often a gamma prior with $\alpha \approx 0$ and $\beta \approx 0$, what is the reasoning for this? "uninformative prior" look like? 

What is the posterior distribution? 

Sequentially estimate the posterior distribution.
